1,"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal  
the setting of the film is a town named blue bay  
it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors  
the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school  
it is here that we meet all of the core characters  
there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan  
we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly  
throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape  
shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well  
this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted  
during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her  
however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor  
after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her  
it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together  
it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda  
matt dillon stars as sam lombardo  
sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage  
he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance  
however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place  
neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller "
1,"i swear i have seen the edge before  
in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence  
even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s  
the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  
i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  
this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world )  
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely )  
the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film  
but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively )  
charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character  
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness "
1,"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to  
it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy  
yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story  
the wings of the dove fits the pattern  
kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love  
merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate  
but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class  
her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man  
naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich  "" 
kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable  
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice  
at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees  
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her  
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup  
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it  
he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute  
the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated  
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton  
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate  
kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple "
1,"i know what i would do with $4  4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou  
 ( huh ? ) 
well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in  
he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck  
against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities  
the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? 
a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle  
oh , and its much better than any of those  
sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture  
he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do  
i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course  
one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line  
in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story  
it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water  
sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts  
raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters  
i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film  
and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood  
if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok  
he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here  
it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so "
1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back

1,"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies "

1,"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur  "" 
instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them  
chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal  
bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood  
bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure  
the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house  
since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films  
we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness  
but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film  
rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom  
lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh  
the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot  
even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment  
he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion  
when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense  
it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire  
bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds  
 "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music  
he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits  
the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest "
1,"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
the mummy 
brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone    
fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising )  
it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in  
but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon  
fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground  
basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress  
his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible  
of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j  o'connor ) and some "" americans ""    and 
guess what ? 
yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc  
fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold  
ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough  
the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either  
the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well  
no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy  
if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will "

1," "" it's not good to know too much about someone , charlie , "" charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin  
charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her "" soul mate "" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name  
there's a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east  
mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt  
and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim  
the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police  
john gay's script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder  
karen arthur's direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense  
when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don't know about his nefarious activities  
he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway  
two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the "" average american family , "" but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background  
charlie , who first welcomed her uncle's visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters  
the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers  
the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other  
she wants him to leave , and he doesn't want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim  
will charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town  
harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped  
with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s  
my only quibble is the director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train  
is hitchcock's version better ? 
of course "

1,"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex  
it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year )  
in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman  
they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other  
he is an m  d  , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party  
at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else  
when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night  
he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with  
they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer  
she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night  
bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient  
this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town  
the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down  
he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street  
then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other  
erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider

1,"anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline  
it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman  
anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband  
with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language  
mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world  
anna function is to help provide that link  
the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate  
foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder  
she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him  
it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career  
she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster  
it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy  
when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance  
chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so  
this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years  
he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern  
it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance  
precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner  
it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story

with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit

1,"urban legend surprised me  
based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena  
thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  
you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks    the 
only person you didn't suspect ! 
however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment  
it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year  
the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive  
maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt )  
or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks  
more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise  
i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman  
urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film  
a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill  
one problem , though  
would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? 
i thought not  
predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company  
it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line  
naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off "
1,"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead  
bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend )  
the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years  
followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 )  
the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1  33 : 1  
the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2  0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5  1  
included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell  
campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film  
such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard  
also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods  
for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene  
almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene  
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track  
the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all  
don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time  
sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? "" 
to me , that's not a good sign  
also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince  
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her  
this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  
while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  
do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? 
is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? 
 ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan  ) 
fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast  
chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film  
 ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber  )

1,"good films are hard to find these days  
great films are beyond rare  
proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems  
a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true  
consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world  
i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway  
but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review  
the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers  
upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million  
the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money  
with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband  
but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands  
the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors  
the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne  
the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso  
dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor  
ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne  
the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes  
the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters  
the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise "
1,"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses  
see contact with your family  
it is a movie for all ages  
--a review by stuart cracraft 
contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 
after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof  morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side  
by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there  
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies  
however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s  r  
hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive  
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal )  
this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice  
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation  
foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms  
early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this  
the movie's pacing is very good and subtle  
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful  
the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however  
one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation  
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored "
1,"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter  "" 
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr  woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole  
 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 
mr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker  
that's right  
i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time  
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater  
you silly goose  
well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life  
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof  
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  
he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug  
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win  
in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play  
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand  
months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  
when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash "
1,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry  
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script  
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order  
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws  
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes  
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws  
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl  
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard  
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs  
this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced  
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone  
the film only gets better from this point  
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats  
they walk in unison and they only look forward  
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens  
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films  
one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world  
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless  
 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film "
1,"if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in "" i went down  "" 
gleeson , who's not dissimilar to the late "" saturday night live "" alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film  
bunny is sent to county cork to "" retrieve "" one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle )  
bunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies  
that tom french is a mean bollocks  
he wants frank back  
and a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom's wife was supposed to have given to frank  
for this he won't break anyone's thumbs  
maybe  
inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , "" i went down "" follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble  
mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , "" the butcher boy  "" 
even if you can't comprehend half of what they're saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make "" i went down "" a trip worth taking  
the film is in many ways reminiscent of another "" little "" independent feature , 1991's "" highway 61  "" 
that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud  
witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company  
that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in "" highway 61  "" 
what's also charming about "" i went down "" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops  
their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it's handled is neither sappy nor labored  
the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom  
it's a little too hollywood , and what makes "" i went down "" so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies "
1,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question  
still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated "

1,"we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist  
years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world  
the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown  
based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father  
in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy  
the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys  
david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia  
the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house  
he is well lit via the external house lights  
his teacher isn't home  
we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open  
there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano  
david's fall over the dark cliff has begun  
instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction ""  
this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets  
the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion  
adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion  
the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out  
whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work  
his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny "

1,"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  
this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn  
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  
 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him  ) 
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm  
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas

jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  
of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell  
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police

1,"ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers  
synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? 
in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem  
dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery  
poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner  
a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt )  
is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? 
he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues  
but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city  
to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city  
how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? 
and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? 
every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles  
the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers  
turns out , the city is not on earth at all  
and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers  
even with the help of scientist dr  daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? 
opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always "" used to have big spaceships blow up cities  
i think we're a little tired of that  "" 
according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers  
it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch  
it's a philosophical piece  
cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force )  
but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? 
what is the human condition ? 
what is ethical ? 
what would a true human being do ? 
far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner "
1,"what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker  
the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! 
i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" 
and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play  
nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman  
nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series )  
on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny  
his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film  
but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind  
the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister  
this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! 
but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman  
like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader  
but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! 
keaton delivers  
he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman  
even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city  
visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team  
the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke  "" 
burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen  
the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations  
nicholson isn't joking when he boasts , "" wait 'till they get a load of me ! "" 
his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous  
keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate  
batman's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop "
1," "" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was  
i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that  
maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick  
 "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever  
 "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining  
it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz  "" 
it's also light and clever  
the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender  
the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films  
the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from "" antz , "" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z  instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper  
and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames  
not that the plot's really any better than the one in "" antz "" - it's basically yet another redux of "" the seven samurai , "" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else  
when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers  
he runs into a group of "" warrirors "" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses  
these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish  
the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats  
grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake  
a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death  
the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says "" kid tore off wings "
1,"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film  
with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa  
attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs  
i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology  
as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master  
as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality  
crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category  
crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology  
it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable  
all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement  
the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two  
it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend  
the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented  
the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively  
the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake  
there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry  
as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy  
do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed  
for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance  
there are no weak performances in this movie "
1,"do film critics have morals ? 
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc  the difference ? 
well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much )  
on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
can't be that good )  
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense ? 
ok , but what about comparing ? 
isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
i think it is , and i'll tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 
it was sooooo cheezy ! "" 
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important ? 
and which is better ? 
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 
getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" 
and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier  
 ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l  jackson and comparison #2 )  
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way "

1,"one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse  
wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains  
they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film  
again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in  
the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , "" guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back  "" 
fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot  
the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color  
highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some "" naked indian guy , "" an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at  
and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you'll find out here  
this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more  
garth has somewhat of a "" coming of age "" and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison )  
a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused  
overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne's world  
the plot is flimsy but manageable  
there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot  
the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots  
in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun  
there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special  
during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn't even think about looking at my watch a single time  
silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original "
1,"armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking  
stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up  
armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer  
but i loved every freaking minute of it  
believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are  
hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place  
the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running  
i'm sorry , but "" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! "" 
isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie  
it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing    )  
i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year  
neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice  
of course , you all know the story  
when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! )  
in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters  
belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's  
also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers

10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew  
that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short  
with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance  
yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage  
the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford  
their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly  
in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family "" no dating "" policy is amended to "" bianca can date    when 
[katarina] does  "" 
with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew  
don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister ""    is a particularly hideous breed of loser  "" 
getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing  
when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice  
the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit "" someone with money  "" 
in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca

1,"the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is  
think about it    
these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public  
they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those  
and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet  
when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie ""  
look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide    
all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment  
gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u  s  naval submarine during world war ii  
we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton )  
mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence  
the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters  
the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence  
the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion "

1,"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment ""  
i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition  
i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit  
fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc  culture  cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs  
i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so  
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement  
as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident  
the proper questions to put relate to castro's legitimacy  
i bet the film takes castro's power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba's state control , cannot question his right to run cuba's political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years )  
that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime  
let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up  
i saw the film--twice  
i was right ; castro remained intact  
strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young "" dialectic materialist , "" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba  
the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution's reason for being  
grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty  
therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians  
cuba's government is castro "
1,"mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er  
her mast famous episode , "" love's labour lost "" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child  
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing  
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies  
so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster  
and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint  
peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new  
the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen  
despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent  
it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better  
once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off  
george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world  
he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters  
nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling  
there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly  
the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them  clooney 
goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt

synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing  
super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver's scheme  
this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh )  
the film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments  
opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie  
it neither stands out nor disappoints  
in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter  
tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin  
like leiter's character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie  
stars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar  
i dont believe in horoscopes  
but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts )  
 "" leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace

1,"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list  
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle  
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws  
together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy  
but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  
although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2  
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary  
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot  
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19  
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience  
because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  
in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u "
1,"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself  
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself  
the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself  
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role  
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling  
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple  
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex  
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder  
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously  
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l  a "
1,"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' "" blood simple  "" 
both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes  
the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands  
both films are also flawed , but for different reasons  
 "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow  
 "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending  
the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end  
as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow  
they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch  
a man named hugo moves into the apartment's remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose  
juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities )  
the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning  
all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next  
other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills  
i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot  
broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process  
a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective  
david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects  
director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other  
while i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue "

the people vs  larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler  
based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life  
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance  
he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus  
by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt  
this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court  
however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means  
larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love  
larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love )  
both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs  
flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin  
althea had joined him in taking the drugs  
following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them  
as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick  
courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect  
it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away

1,"when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low  
a show about nothing ? 
sounds like "" seinfeld  "" 
a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? 
sounds like "" the truman show  "" 
what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? 
which is why i was pleasantly surprised by "" edtv , "" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity  
the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus  
in the hands of a less-experienced director , "" edtv "" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf  
with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers  
program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment  
the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to  
while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame  
but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray  
he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick  
cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages  
the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth  
 "" action shot ! "" 
wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster  
you get the idea  
but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it  
ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media  
who should ed go out with ? 
you can be sure the pollsters have a list  
not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent "
1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends "

1,"when i left the theater after seeing david lynch's "" lost highway , "" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , "" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears  "" 
in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture "" eraserhead "" on the weirdness scale  
you won't "" know "" what happened when it's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses  
it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it  
i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l  a  jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep  
they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving  
the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom  
he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty )  
the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man  
i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end  
this description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time  
on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther  
the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery  
there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here  
we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent  
all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style  
as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway "" it works perfectly  
there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour  
 ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way  ) 
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out )  
the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis  
it's also vastly more convincing with its argument  
 "" mathematics is the language of the universe , "" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture  
since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning  
obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system  
sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness  
the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood  
it helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist  
all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries  
for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr  gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest  
still , we do care about max's fate  
teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions  
as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary  
pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality "

alluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding  
after taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land  
the production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters  
but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "" the deep end "" gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating

margaret demands that darby leave her son alone , only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be glad to steer clear of beau ? for $5000  
back at home , she tries to talk about it all with her son , but the kid won't even confirm that he's gay , let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend  
he does , however , get attentive when she reveals darby's $5 , 000 offer , even as he maintains his sullen demeanor  
late in the evening , darby shows up outside , tossing pebbles at beau's window like a schoolchild  
the two meet by the water at the boathouse , where something important happens  
i won't reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not

1," ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) 
we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world  
and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon )  
no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat  
about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no'  
the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry  
she can't go higher than him  
he won't allow it  
and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor  
early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher  
it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist  
and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters  
it's with mandy barnett's "" if you'll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony  
sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success  
it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries  
satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not  
it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind )  
payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart  
we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about  
minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller's day off ""

this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match

1,"james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual  
a veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature  
they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus  
but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick  
the book's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value  
each of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones' examination of world war ii on the american soldier  
there's a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast  
but most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used  
malick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake  
the issues at stake are many and one  
told from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( "" c-for-charlie "" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal  
the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war  
and want to win the war they do

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air  
it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't  
it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't  
and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending  
even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless  
hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic )  
yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  
weird  
this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list  "" 
in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  
after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  
 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  
and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film  
it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying  
if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way  
but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine  
but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it  
it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins

1,"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film  
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking  
yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness  
the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft  
while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass  
this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is  
much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers  
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff  
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city  
however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l  jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors  
when a privileged young man named walter wade jr  ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p  i  
but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime  
peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film  
peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages  
however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming )  
it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless  
then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars "
1,"warning : contains what the matrix is  
rated r for sci-fi violence  
starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano 
some may be disappointed with the matrix  
i'll tell you i was  
i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen  
now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it  
what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow  
now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show  
don't be fooled , this movie has a big story  
and big chunks of talky moments  
but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above  
ok now to the story  
well this may take a while  
ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix  
a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world  
he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be  
but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him  
laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves  
but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were  
yeah there were some in the first half but not enough "
1,"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year  
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office  
this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy  
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them  
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza  
in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell  
he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra  
evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable  
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there  
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors )  
now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead  "" 
the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book  
along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra  
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt  
don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time  
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers  
on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide  
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though  
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world  
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin "
1,"a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of "" simon birch , "" the treatment is merely "" suggested by , "" rather than strictly based on , the book  
suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names  
that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product  
irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters  
 "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice  "" 
simon believes himself to be "" god's instrument , "" placed on this earth to somehow effect god's plan  
simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally  
smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best  
another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail  
watching "" simon birch , "" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended  
simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter  
fortunately , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bears his name  
simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny  
first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe  
mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent  
ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben  
david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others  
there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from   "
1,"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over  
one could almost say the same about his much-prized film  
rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth  
in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood  
yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind  
ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film  
but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him  
his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld  
the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many  
juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart  
at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger  
even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical  
with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing  
yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air  
hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war  
there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years  
but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed  
in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore  
bore is perhaps too strong a word  
but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full "
1,"ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood

1,"i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before  
pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films  
have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? 
more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff  
i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad  
it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered  
somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography  
the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment  
but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time  
nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life  
meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive  
after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor  
he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday  
angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire  
seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community  
the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness  
cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once  
it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire  
the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy  
but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye  
it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it "

it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life  
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  
therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner  
it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself  
the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war  
this plays a major factor in the film's success  
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy

the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect  
the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians  
he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes  
after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug  
the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l  a  so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug  
the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped  
he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers  
dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers  
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny  
it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films  
not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure  
all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived  
each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension  
the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh  
it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie  
worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator

1,"what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection  
sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking  
the thin red line is flawed but it provokes  
terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war  
unlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste  
while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is  
saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs  
one message is not necessarily more correct than the other  
it just depends on one's point of view  
in malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush  
the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? 
in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go  
in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place  
they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying  
all that separates them is war  
the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs  
unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary  
dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur  
instead , he gets distracting self-consciousness  
aside from that , malick's direction is stunning

her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school

while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view  
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil )  
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker  
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  
even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  
in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  
like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  
when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  
however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  
stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present  
as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  
these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently  
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  
however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  
however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  
consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays "
1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life "
1,"known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone  
the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable  
the other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here  
edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel  
stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions  
agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor  
this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night  
just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear  
the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers  
since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss  
allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella  "" 
the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been  
you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha  
the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner  
and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers  
you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's  
additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts  
playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa  
julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989's "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence  
it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j "
1,"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really  
it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target )  
in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians  
these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed )  
this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by    well , 
you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is )  
moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do )  
in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do )  
this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think  
after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do )  
movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle  
maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway )  
the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense )  
in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story  
unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he    well ,

1,"a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters  
1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting  
as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar  
not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics  
as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it  
the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it  
however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film  
and to my surprise , it grew on me  
the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship  
see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend  
also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out  
carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc  he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done  
for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few  
perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny  
and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam  
the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie  
i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend  
also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing  
still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out "
1,"one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length  
if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap  
but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent  
boogie nights falls into the latter catagory  
the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along  
mark whalberg , a  k  a 
marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area  
jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business  
after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies  
in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h  macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script  
we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband  
but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing  
the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up  
there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches  
the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 )  ) 
boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) 
the soundtrack is also excellent  
like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift  
also , the costumes are great "
1,"the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , "" snatch  "" 
 "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end  
his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive  
with "" snatch , "" the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process  
>from the very beginning , "" snatch "" tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina )  
en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug "" the head "" ( mike reid )  
frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris "" the blade "" ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster  
the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry  
meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm  
when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight  
mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal  
brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse  
when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , "" bullet tooth "" tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond  
things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy  
guy ritchie ( mr  madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire  
the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example  
the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives "" snatch "" an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld  
the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting  
alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top "
1,"originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i  e  
 "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman  
plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love ? 
why do people fall out of love ? 
how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip , young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples' issues  
others with the married  
there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very , very good "
1,"jerry springer has got nothing on "" wild things  "" 
john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline  
but even trash tv topicality can't drag "" wild things "" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast  
despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here  
 "" wild things "" would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it  
high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent  
hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped  
before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court  
the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph  
while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her  
to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8  5 million  
but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can  
duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations  
if there's a major drawback to "" wild things , "" it's that it's oversexed to a fault  
the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off  
it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often  
what we don't see is far more effective than what we do  
another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene "
1,"'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed 
 ( www  pleasantville  com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) 
cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h  macy , joan allen , j  t  
walsh , jeff daniels 
mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements 
genre : drama 
in my opinion : 
in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is  
review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions  
the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant  
there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate  
put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for  
j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an "" oldies "" tv station ? or is it ? 
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed  
i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office  
but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy "" dollar theaters "" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced  
it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all  
instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right  
there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story  
now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be  
besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch  
the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable  
after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more "
1,"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy  "" 
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my money's worth  
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica "
1,"not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies  
if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way  
this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie  
gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it  
it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser )  
it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to "" sit for him , "" ( pose for a portrait )  
at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man  
when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy  
but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's "" locker room talk  "" 
boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned "" locker room talk , "" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening  
meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago  
his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor  
what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example )  
i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here  
this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking  
that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well  
this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn  
he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem  
whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield  
he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people "

1,"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film  
the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars  
to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film  
as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin  
the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous  
this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds  
it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film  
 "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america  
jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental  
in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers  
he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present  
preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters  
the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted  
tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him  
as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist  
poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character  
never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing  
however , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance  
as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role  
he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople "

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them  
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci )  
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife "
1,"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image  
when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships  
when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point  
cool  
_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky  
was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? 
have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? 
it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal  
determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them  
it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket  
when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win  
but the joy in a film like this is in the little details  
for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class  
if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer  
it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does  
it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again  
homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_  
here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions  
this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is  
he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams  
but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how

1,"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards  
the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u  s  distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints  
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe  
both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue  
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed  
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one  
everyone knows the story of dracula  
or do they ? 
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt  
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown  
upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her  
locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him  
upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises  
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art  
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised  
the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising "
1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact "
1,"when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster  
now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought "" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? ""  
as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy  
robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit  
don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference  
based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith  
allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer  
she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system  
her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her  
a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied "" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now ""  
allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation  
her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti  
undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation  
the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave  
the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government  
the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission  
as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go  
she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation  
her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning  
at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor "
1,"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric  
ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning  
many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room  
the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford )  
director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion  "" 
despite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment  
while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi  
this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable  
he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it's about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" )  
unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress  
it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine  
the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection  
in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista  
on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped  
a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color  
there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences  
nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment  
while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear  
overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed  
when the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed "
1," "" when it's cold , molecules aren't moving  
everything is clean  "" 
these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm  
when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him  
his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline )  
ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything  
meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations  
tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character  
we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul  
he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return  
the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie  
everything parallels everything else  
the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods  
 "" when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving  
everything is clean  "" 
everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on  
even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings  
how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? 
all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film  
at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ? 
you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either  
we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another "
1,"a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family  
the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based  
my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) 
i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film  
it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture  
for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc  although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , "" a graduate of several 12-step programs  "" 
stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles  
stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking  
then , disaster strikes  
stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked  
he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up  
franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people  
although smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy  
also , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought  
although filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion  
for a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called "" serious dramas "" of today  
all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit  
if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out  
you'll laugh  "
1,"the small-scale film , in limited release , "" waking ned devine "" is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town  
filled with breathtaking scenery , 'characters' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot  
the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review  
the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny  
what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore  
who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly )  
part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds  
the village consists of several amusing characters  
a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch  
there's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up  
there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ]  
pacing is right  
towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we've been interested in the goings on  
a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged  
in one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists  
one of the key moments in the film  
the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering  
a fine film that's for everybody except action fans  
somewhat like 'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , '  "
1,"it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that  
and so it is  
_the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i've seen since i-don't-know-when  
don't credit carrey  
it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago  
the story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience  
 ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that "" reality-based "" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture  
who knew ? ) 
one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place  
weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling  
it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame  
for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_  
the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island  
credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey  
carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near  
not here  
his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on  
and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably  
playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life  
no pun intended  
better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian "

on this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on  
the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win  
but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began

stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g  i  
and your jewish man raising a family  
stempel has been the reigning champion on "" twenty-one "" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars  
in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him  
although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old  
dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a "" jewish guy from queens with bad teeth "" and that the kids need someone better to look up to  
therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win  
someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating  
enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family  
van doren had decided to try out for the game show "" tic tac dough "" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing  
but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the "" twenty-one "" kingdom

after stempel loses the "" throne "" to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should )

either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny  
why is this ? 
maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional  
director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day  
when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again  
i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends  
i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time  
and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around  
rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all  
he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman  
and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort  
he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it  
whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co  
grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives  
rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in  
during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him  
but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life )  
the plot in three words is : women and music  
the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective  
it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle "

a review by jamey hughton stars ) 
starring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g 
with all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film  
the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together  
can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away     ? 
yes  this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity  
but that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment  
the phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history  
the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film  
the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding  
the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects  
after we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan'  
they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo  
oh , but enough about that  
the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture  
as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader  
a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter  
this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see "

an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial  
even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together  
the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines  
aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us  
she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor  
latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey  
dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration  
even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants  
several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both  
there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love  
some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films  
western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna  
on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films "
1,"once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow )  
unwittingly befriended by a non-stop talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner  
his prize ? 
to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad's bride  
the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in "" shrek  "" 
it took four writers ( ted elliott and terry rossio ( "" the road to el dorado "" ) , roger s  h  
schulman ( "" balto "" ) and joe stillman ( "" beavis and butthead do america "" ) ) to adapt william steig's children's book  
the bad news ? 
they've genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman's "" the princess bride  "" 
the good news ? 
there's so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches  
we get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of farquaad's men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks' rendition of disney's animated pinocchio  
meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured 
by farquaad spits icing and yells 'eat me ! ' 
before breaking down and solemnly asking 'do you know the muffin man ? ' 
shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? )  
donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek  
donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon  
the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been expecting  
when fiona's true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek  
the script's details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad's dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and 'it's a small world' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona 'snow white' style  
popular culture is represented with film references to "" babe "" and "" charlies' angels "" via "" the matrix  "" 
myers chooses his 'so i married an axe murderer' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft  
while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not  
eddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney's 'mulan ? ' ) "
1,"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies  
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  
heh ! 
them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em  
of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters  
that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing  
confused ? 
let me explain : 
despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie  
luckily , it's a very good b movie  
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter  
therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  
of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  
we just don't know when or how horrible it will be  
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times  
a funny b movie ? 
well , that's new  
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh  
 ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while "
1,"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! "" 
 ( actually , it's "" lock and load "" ) , you can't help thinking tarantino  
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers  
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon  
 "" inspired by true events "" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated    
or so strangely poignant  
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged  
beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker  
they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris  
when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up  
then , chris begins to rob banks    
luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer  
moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband  
 ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory )  
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person  
if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia  
as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece "
1,"the happy bastard's quick movie review 
me tarzan    you 
happy viewer  
for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past  
 ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? 
yikes ! ) 
but guess what- disney , a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you  
the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group  
as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons  
from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? 
the voicework here is pretty top-level  
tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne "" newman "" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant  
the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals  
when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly  
i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast  
and the music's not half bad , either  
fortunately , there's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood  
there's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons  
but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family  
this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library   "
1,"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream )  
but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again  
weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything )  
but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why  
four words : contract with the devil  
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america  "" 
no , satan is much more humane  
anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld  
how do i know ? 
i own the document in question  
amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ? 
get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer  
he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game  
sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point  
palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito  
it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who's the boss ? "" 
to speechless  
it works in this case , unlike "" who's the boss ? "" 
although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also  
complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting  
get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities  
this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi )  
get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence  
i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on "
1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent "

1,"back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "" antz ""  
the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office  
again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film "" the prince of egypt "" and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well  
on a winning streak , they released "" the road to el dorado "" and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic "" chicken run "" in the summer  
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films  
shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself  
surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone  
the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested  
of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy )  
a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek  
lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house  
to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king  
shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona  
 "" shrek "" is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this  
the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic  
i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be  
i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year  
the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers  
in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer  
now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent "
1,"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings  
a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school  
less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp  here the setting was the corporate world of new york  
now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies  
like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player  
julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution  
josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion  
o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy  
the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? 
- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim  
an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits  
and that is how it should be  
of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery  
kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts  
the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin  
plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood  
the script follows the familiar lines of the classic  
hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game  
it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved  
the performances in o vary "
1,"every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he's not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre  
not to mention an expensive one  ) 
sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago  
with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 )  
directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 )  
while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale  
and boy , did he take that route ! 
i'd say at about 165 mph or so    
the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt  ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel  
if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship  
unfortunately , she thought she'd only be out for a couple of weeks    
once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy  
in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor ""  
it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost   "
1,"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career  
based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system  
beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown  
after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt  ) 
instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him  
however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin  
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry  ) 
it's remarkable that this film was released at all  
much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name  
the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true  
it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject  
talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun  
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed  
even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor  
 ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see  ) 
the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well  ) 
and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed  
it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself  
second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps  
halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator "

lotsa nuttiness ensues and then , they pick up their other friend , venna , a girl who the dude has a crush on  
but what's this    ? 
the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers    ? 
you bet ! 
buckle up , dorothy    this is gonna be one bumpy ride ! 
critique : a good ol' time at the movies ! 
here's a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything "" new "" to the forefront ( if you've seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you've crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang  
let's give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven't seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience )  
and much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace  
it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone ! 
paul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! ) 
but here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters  
sobieski is also good , but she isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn  
if you've loved this guy as the "" goofball "" in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( "" this is so awesome ! ! "" ) , 
only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick  
and speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? 
the arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level  
once again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork "
1," "" the faculty , "" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's "" desperado "" and 1996's "" from dusk till dawn "" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's "" scream "" and 1997's "" scream 2 "" ) , is being called a cross between "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the breakfast club , "" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that  
the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town  
the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town  
although the characters are only slightly connected ( i  e  
casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc  ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another  
 "" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's  
williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer  
the plotline of "" the faculty , "" involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" to "" the puppet masters , "" to "" invaders from mars , "" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful  
surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't  
the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better  
the performances in "" the faculty "" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do  
one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster  
as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( "" t2 : judgement day "" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role  
the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell  
if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence  
since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the "" queen "" alien , many of the faculty members disappear  
it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget  
although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , "" the faculty "" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released "
1,"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart  
however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock  
nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest  
the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole  
the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama  
the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages  
the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end  
instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans  
they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin  
we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled  
there is comedy and tragedy  
most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth  
the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year  
it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over  
the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance  
it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured  
there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship  
the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson )  
these two have a stormy relationship  
they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other "
1,"notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage  
the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter  
and it apparently worked  
perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth  
allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill  
grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill  
into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts )  
a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss  
days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair  
 ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate  ) 
only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them  
richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's "" beauty and the beast "" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order  
as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna  
curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family  
by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate  
yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband  
in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life  
the scene ends only as a british writer would end it  
if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact  
roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely "
1," "" through a spyglass , i could see everything  "" 
king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar  
consider it a view to a kill made abstract  
a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants  
the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , "" i don't know , "" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air  
what we don't see might not be able to hurt us  
just close your eyes and think of england  
during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them  
adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc  ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history  
resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes  
grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along  
a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus )  
the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence  
during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake  
rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob  
in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death  
when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears  
grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob  
through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape "
1,"steven spielberg's "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story  
first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery  
second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins )  
last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade  
 "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements  
i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie  
having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it  
fortunately , i turned out to be wrong  
for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning  
and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery  
one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year  
spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating  
the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time  
exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation  
the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court  
the biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court  
through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ  
cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles  
 "" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? "" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court  
spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room "

1,"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 
cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an anti-movie , of sorts  
there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai "
1,"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year  
from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998  
it is that good of a film  
when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous  
how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? 
but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about  
once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer  
and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special  
now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding )  
the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for )  
forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses  
in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade  
but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart  
you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers  
they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around )  
they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses  
it's funny , though  
if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable  
but believe me , it is anything but  
ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz )  
after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w "
1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel "
1,"not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies  
like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations  
also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces  
and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film  
all that is missing is a discussion of god  
which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master  
in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind  
nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms  
once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards  
one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is  
though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all  
whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary  
the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors  
it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting  
much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is  
there are a few missteps  
for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film  
this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout  
and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced  
for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by "

1," "" desperate measures "" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97  
for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january  
now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film  
michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia )  
keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape  
he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies  
the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son  
the film definately has it's flaws  
the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status  
also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him "" how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? "" 
which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark  
the thing is , it's a vaild point  
how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? 
what's the greater good here ? 
many lives or one life ? 
if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character  
place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else  
alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable  
despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about "" desperate measures "" outnumber the bad  
the main highlight would be keaton's performance  
the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely  
he's not as menacing as he was in "" pacific heights "" or even as menacing as he was in "" batman "" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil  
even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film  
so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest "
1,"perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits  
i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime  
my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book )  
in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century  
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations )  
however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film  
needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based  
i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision  
i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh  
it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered  
out of sight proves that it doesn't  
i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair  
after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars  
here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living  
he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start  
he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames )  
we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u  s  marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes  
fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety "
1,"it's hard not to recommend "" the others  "" 
the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace  
the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances  
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied  
overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy  
watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! "" 
as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same  
set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman  
anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time  
at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs  mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr  tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family  
the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not  
to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts  
grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them  
that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear  
earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog  
the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding  
i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural  
grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper  
when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do "
1,"as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous  
almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america  
so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it  
it has been done before with varying results  
this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time  
the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story  
there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature  
after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least  
  
unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end  
the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her  
although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling   
the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion  
this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical  
for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired  
for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that  
especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne  
the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women  
although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable "
1,"tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way  
if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points  
when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary  "" 
what's eating gilbert grape ? 
is such a film  
it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence  
gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities  
as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store  
he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates )  
gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down  
as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing  
slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people  
director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel  
endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else  
the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real  
minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife  
one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band  
not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false  
the same can be said of the character of gilbert  
it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once  "" 
gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty "

1,"scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film  
it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery  
the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time  
scream was also known for its self-referential tone  
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven  
again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels  "" 
scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's  
sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college  
gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream )  
at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins  
the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer  
they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders  
the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference  
the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers  
the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press  
the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene  
 ( whew  ) 
the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch  
even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2  that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie "

1,"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt )  
when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory  
my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you )  
the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that  
arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion  
many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it  
one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? 
please    
if rose mcgowan is sexy then i'm marilyn manson  
given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he'd be the most popular guy they have  
on a similar note , the "" plot line "" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years  
although one does have to ask    
why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ? 
director brian robbins ( you'll remember him as eric from tv's "" head of the class "" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies  
this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues  
and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me  
the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan  
those moments made me cringe and/or groan "
1,"we all know the fate of "" child's play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell  
with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about  
alas , the original "" child's play "" actually isn't that bad  
even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie  
it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone  
the premise of "" child's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen  
the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday  
of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up  
like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy  
and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one  
the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that  
it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy  
it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments  
even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , 
there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience  
the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with  
if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child's play "" steers away from that  
and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! 
that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character  
if there's anything really wrong with "" child's play , "" it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem  
at almost 90 minutes , "" child's play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror  
it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll "
1,"metro i've seen san francisco in movies many times  
there was 1994's interview with the vampire and most recently the rock  
now , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie  
eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd  he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does  
when his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again  
meanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex-girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who's an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport )  
despite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way ? ) 
where the sgt  
assigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc  , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride  
a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts  
eddie murphy shines in this tailor-made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern  
when confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word  
michael rappaport is basically throwaway  
he serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day  
typical action escapist fare  
michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe  
never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously  
maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott's perfectly raspy voice  
i don't know "

1,"produced by robert lantos & stephen j  roth 
directed by douglas williams 
mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg ) 
though made in canada , "" overdrawn at the memory bank "" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production  
using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked  
raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority  
caught watching "" casablanca "" on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to "" doppling "" rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon  
 ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess  ) 
as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it  
as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on    while 
fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside  
during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings  
over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance  
given that "" casablanca "" is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to "" casablanca ""  
in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called "" the place ""  
julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the "" schweethaat "" -spouting parody seen in cartoons  
negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing  
the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system  
those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances  
the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around "
1,"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton  
this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust  
but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice  
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore  
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence  
he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government  
instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official  
in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter  
guido wins dora  
they marry  
fast forward about five years  
guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family  
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore  
but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities  
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp  
here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated  
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched  
for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list  
true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor  
unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust "
1,"carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall  
the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects  
action and science fiction just don't get any better than this ! 
the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone )  
quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars  
while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased  
now the people who did it are after him  
quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead  
the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist  
it grabs you and never lets go ! 
this film is a winner from beginning to end  
the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga  
schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too  
the action and stunts are terrific  
the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail  
the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action  
the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish  
the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! 
the visuals had such a state of the art "" slickness "" that they won an oscar  
of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science  
for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do  
who cares ? 
it's a movie  
movies are supposed to entertain "
1,"capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer  
roars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious  
to talk about jackie chan as a "" stuntman "" is to miss a million things  
jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy  
he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there , copping a look  
supercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene  
it's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it  
 ( the others are also worth seeing  ) 
it's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it's a field day  
the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind  
kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh )  
there's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform  
kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss  
the drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds  
this means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and    but that's one of the movie's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly  
action  there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! )

little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture  
it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound  
actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p  i  ""  
in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on  
hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas  
however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well  
looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not  
an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra  
during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong  
also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence  
both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom

critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted "" non-teen "" movie starring a bunch of teens  
credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core  
you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs  
hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me )  
phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character  
i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along  
julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently  
i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years  
his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all  
a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest  
i did have a few reservations about the movie though "
1,
1,"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation  
on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  
on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events  
this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  
indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  
_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war  
for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil  
oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end  
what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished  
_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin  
the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse  
invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards  
sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves  
demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects  
all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real  
when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror  
instead , he asks who the ghost is  
as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created  
sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears  
in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay "
1,"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina  
the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away  
the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads  
at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act  
that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave  
deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 )  
the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered  
over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over  
other plot elements are thrown in for good measure  
wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent  
braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate  
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful  
the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners  
deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense  
the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting  
deceiver has the power to grab an audience  
unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing  
for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers "
1,"in many ways , "" twotg "" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories  
there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold  
but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us "" the usual suspects ""  
his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry  
the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro )  
these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough  
their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive  
given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter  
yet , they are incredibly foolish planners  
actually , these two never really have a plan  
they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked  
their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family  
if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on  
what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss  
moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her  
these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations  
they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high  
but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways  
the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation  
during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed "
1,"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact  
four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film  
the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy  
contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space  
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms )  
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive  
ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young  
in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth ""  
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together  
it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on  
meanwhile , dr  david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding  
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember  
it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science  
when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at  
eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated )  
the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? )  
as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer  
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs  religion "
1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth  
as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration  
during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo  ' 
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead  ' 
a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  
he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  
by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
but how realistic are these ideals ? 
joe had raped and been raped in texas  
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny "
1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective "
1,"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes  
many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit  
i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter  
it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be  
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! "" 
mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us  
as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty  "" 
in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman  
she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job  
positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking  
meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires  
two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition  
as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further  
i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot  
that's probably because it isn't one  
these are people  
this is their story  
director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting  
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue  
supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners  
carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character "
1," "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to  
everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions  
no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present  
this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute  
in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does  
not only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure  
each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection  
this is because times change and in response people change  
no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light  
this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents  
even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this  
in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults  
they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored  
this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another  
speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by  
the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation  same 
goes for brando , redford , even deniro  
i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century  
will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? 
any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film  
even if "" rebel without a cause "" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film "
1,"the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one  
this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something  
the church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained  
in these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson  
jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess   
is just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first  
at the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however  
but bess is suffering in this scary religious society  
we soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell  
women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church  
when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit  
the time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves  
she can't stand the thought of life without her husband  
we witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? ) 
convincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard  
an accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down  
now he can't satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail  
at first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply  
imagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? 
the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others  
the use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre "
1,"only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters  
while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story  
the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant  
the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening  
i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy  
its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else  
the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general  
although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well  
everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time  
more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film  
the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show  
understandably , "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted  
couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right  
we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner  
while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing  
unfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window  
for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion  
there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction  
as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor

1,"now that "" boogie nights "" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era  
the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's "" the last days of disco  "" 
stillman , who made "" metropolitan "" and "" barcelona "" using some of the same actors , uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director  
the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) 
men and women of "" the last days of disco "" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection  
here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired  
if talk is cheap , "" the last days of disco "" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot  
what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of "" the lady and the tramp "" )  
na ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house  
charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , "" like a kindergarten teacher  "" 
the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms  beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! )  
here they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college  
des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back  
des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he's gay  
whether it's true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn )  
charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth  
jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of "" barcelona "" ? )  
josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , "" book this clown ! "" 
and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity  
any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book  
in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way "
1,"i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes  
oddly , i've never given much thought to either of the two  
maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam

the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true  
for those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place

chris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie's fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare

1," ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information  ) 
seven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs  
it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled  
while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance  
for starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film  
while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up  
part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style  
he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse  
and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects )  
throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene  
these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing  
yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment  
in addition to style , fincher supplies substance  
seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society  
detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world  
its easy to see why  
the world doesn't make sense  
 ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct  
after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes  ) 
why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and "" picking up the pieces "" he will be able to catch the killer ? 
somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) "
1,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form  
it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre  
what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
well     
1  you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother  
2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  
5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic

1,"have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? 
or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? 
these thought-provoking questions are the subject of "" final destination , "" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "" the sixth sense  "" 
stylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue  
at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris  
progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom  
 "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself  
once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off  
arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates  
as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners  
carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate  
alex's best friend , tod ( chad e  donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents  
the teacher , mrs  lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker  
only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life  
that is only the setup of "" final destination , "" and the less said about what follows , the better  
suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself  
the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and "" final destination "" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years  
graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away  
devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , "" idle hands , "" is even more of a charismatic presence here  
the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part "
1,"you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it  
that's a bit more difficult  
the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies  
if you're not nice to it , you lose  
galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned  
 "" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over  "" 
that is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns  
it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble  
jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do  
the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt  
dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "" by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged "" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans  
one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "" galaxy quest "" followers  
they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia  
they have mistaken the "" galaxy quest "" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel  
the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris )  
nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes  
next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship  
of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them  
but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians  
i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked "
1,"in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural "" rush hour "" - to the tune of about $250 million  
you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in "" rush hour 2  "" 
the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world  
the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable  
i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations  
surprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it  
the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start  
terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime  
concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights  
instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars  
the makers of "" rush hour 2 "" are working at a distinct advantage over the original  
we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around  
that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit  
little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "" rush hour  "" 
first and foremost to me , in "" rh2 , "" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography  
the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint  
chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket  
his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino  
like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch  
chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys "
1," "" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year  
it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords  
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint  
finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie  
stuart little is a mouse  
he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles  
a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city  
they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son  
at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat  
george doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond  
stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are  
the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back  
hesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending  
one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects  
just like in "" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace "" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real  
from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows  
another movie that this has in common with is "" babe "" with it's talking animals and people understanding them  
it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids  
michael j  fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the "" homeward bound "" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could "

1,"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there  
 "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here  
just don't forget to have fun  
clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman  
 "" i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose  
it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start  
this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface  "" 
spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in "" three kings "" ) takes it from there  
the white-hot director of the beastie boy's "" sabotage , "" an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  
jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style  
his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly  
and then there's the cast  
john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows  
over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved  
once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates

1,"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time  
with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way  
while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor  
in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say  
in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past  
he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career  
so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc  as a sort of payment  
the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end  
it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? 
the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner  
speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter  
every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing  
albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character  
the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone  
she wasn't likeable at all  
brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through  
in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak  
luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap  
it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy  
on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low  
oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film  
it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s  
things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier )  
she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster )  
the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown  
meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars  
only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  
although jackie brown marks mr  tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  
while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black  
in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions  
the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era  
the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  
of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year "
1,"plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes  
this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery  
critique : awesome ! 
i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp    so 
yes , i really dug this movie ! 
the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends    is 
very serious ! 
in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell  
it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much  
and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective "" kill scenes "" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances  
in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and "" feel "" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those "" unfortunates "" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers  
you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time  
but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered  
the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel "" from hell "" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? 
yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little "" love "" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already  
that's right , there's no real need to put any "" romance "" in a film about a mass murderer ! 
but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through  
sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one  
i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't )  
on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development  
but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement "

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory  
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there "
1,"plot : derek zoolander is a male model  
he is also very dumb and impressionable  
for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country  
will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? 
will zoolander ever grace the world his new "" look "" ? 
is this a funny movie ? 
find out below    
critique : there's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies ""  
films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes  
there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous  
well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time  
of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead  
i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry  
snap ! 
it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously  
and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others  
i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse  
hi-larious ! 
but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work  
a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? )  
i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! )  
but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! 
i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk-off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( "" i was a merman  "
1,"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned  
the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now  
eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
starring : tom cruise ( dr  
bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice  
16 months for this ? 
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them "
1,"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults  
the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating  
however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away  
both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers  
even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts  
everyone loves surprises  
u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets  
this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off  
set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship  
there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571  
it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships  
the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear )  
once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down  
as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop  
this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all  
the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations  
throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible  
germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny  
all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move  
they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while "
1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play  
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands  
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and 
the game is afoot     
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  
the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft  
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination  "
1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two  
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters  
the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children  
more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure ""  
the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate  
michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling  
constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children  
the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church  
later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million  "" 
but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness  
sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin

1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity  
she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace  
anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces  
i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him ""  
at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car  
cu-sack  cu-sack - no , not quite as cool  
i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) ""  
he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius  
with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's  
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  
despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen  
and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller )  
high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit  
it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank "
1,"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture  
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act  
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious  
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr  ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing  
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman  
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game  
this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem  
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf  
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr  )  
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as    
mike tyson  
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time  
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence  
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls  
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing "
1,"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors  
however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on  
i wasn't disappointed  
it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns  
one thing : what's with the title ? 
not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine  
in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it  
martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney  
he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers  
once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get  
we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney )  
vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series )  
there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces  
we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail  
richard gere does a fairly good job  
at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth  
but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client  
alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role  
laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable  
her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film  
the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good "
1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  
all the films released after it , have been less successful  
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor'  
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture  
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story  
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness  
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between  
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  
in a near future    on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real  
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered  
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence "
1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome "" "
1,"plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy  
but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working  
a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and    okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues  
critique : very cool ! 
now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight ! 
the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain "" cute "" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year  
tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film  
he is pure evil  
they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man  
what a great , great monster ! 
my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole "" kiss of the dragon "" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "" kiss my ass ! "" 
pure action movie poetry  
anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his "" acting "" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character  
actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot  
fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay  
but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances  
we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front  
and yes    they have no wire-fu in this movie "
1,"because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece  
the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked  
to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? 
this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls  
tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories  
for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated "" mars attacks ! "" 
 ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage "" mars attacks ! "" 
trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up  
burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great  
the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold  
like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later  
as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character  
from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc  ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes  
so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders  
as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back  
he doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist )  
as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly  
the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original  
for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay  
the 1968 "" apes "" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending  
but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball  
the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending "
1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )  
but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it  
and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception  
thank god ! 
the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire    and 
co-star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one )  
the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating )  
there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull "
1,"pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time  
in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it  
as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way  
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor  
to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l  jackson )  
these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect  
travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role  
if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the "" problem solver "" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel )  
these are just the major characters  
smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men "" behind "" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film  
the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other  
the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups  
the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead  
after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle  
utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants  
the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace  
after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase  
this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a  357 
 "" hand cannon "" , shooting at the two gangsters "
1,"with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking  
no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved  
but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? 
obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi  
everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects  
overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling  
but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , "" wow    "" 
like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi  
it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien "" phantoms  "" 
whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason )  
while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a "" zeus cannon , "" dr  aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr  sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a "" wave "" using eight collected "" spirits "" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off  
while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't  
it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out  
perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script  
some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay  
nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes  
why do these aliens feed on souls ? 
if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? 
what is so special about the "" spirits "" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? 
worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking "
1,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so )  
however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator  
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal )  
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  
zero takes the case , and the plot thickens  
his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens )  
despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark  
through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him  
i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film  
i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness )  
zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture  
with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them  
but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment  
take , for starters , the great cast of characters  
pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs  
zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe  
pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious  
ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny "
1,"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources  
each review compared this film to the truman show  
why ? 
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television  
other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other  
reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i  e  
the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies  
when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman  
the same goes for the thin red line , as well  
when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever  
critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards  
this is why i think pleasantville was underrated  
if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves  
sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history  
with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents  
his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes  
but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be  
the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote  
their new parents , played by william h  macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way "
1,"scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption  
al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami  
oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles  
the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states  
many of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime  
nearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry  
along with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field  
tony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank's lover  
of course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force  
this is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami  
tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him  
no one can trust him , and basically , no one does  
scarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino  
although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one  
in fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination )  
another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity  
a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word "" fuck "" and it's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record  
the thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie  
as odd as it sounds , it's true  
in the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard "

i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth  
the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars  
based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed  
but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast  
they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action  
and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids  
little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v  evil going on in the depths of space  
one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious  
it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace  
a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key'  
in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? 
mandibles ? 
tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon  
therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners  
otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key'  
now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe  
the mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones  
he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore "

1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 )  
the angels here are stark and believable  
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air  
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well  
they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven  
like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure  
 "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan )  
he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  
maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough  
he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance  
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human  
he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n "
1,"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing  
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare  
while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid  
this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city  
 "" i don't think people listen to guys like me , "" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum  
just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision  
in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs  banks ( blythe danner ) , to "" just listen "" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage  
sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc  , his wife and two children won't be provided for  
he's not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he's somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped any by the fact that banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go  
overall , he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we'd deem "" far enough "" as the starting mark of some crazy race  
meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene  
covering a "" fluff "" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could've hoped for  
having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story  
max immediately bonds with sam  
max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone  
at first , max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him  
the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill  
the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam's honest ambitions "

1,"plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum  
as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion  
saying anything else about the plot would be a crime  
have fun    
critique : "" i feel like shooting myself in the head "" are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here  
this ain't your average "" happy go lucky "" kind of picture  
this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards  
will it bore some people to sleep ? 
you bet it will ! 
is it made for the scream audiences of the day ? 
absolutely not ! 
i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the "" cerebral crowd ""  
a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later  
i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group  
in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a "" mindfuck ""  
if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you ! 
it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole "" peanut butter "" thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark  
 "" brrrrrrrrr    now 
what was that sound in the basement ? 
honey , can you go check ? "" 
and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects  
in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video  "
1,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively  
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great  
underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way  
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point  
it goes from character to character  
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship  
it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real  
in short , this movie is just awesome  
it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers  
director anand tucker tells this story well  
he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real  
the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends  
they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two  
jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned  
when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn )  
they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone  
she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  
it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way  
the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized  
their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another "
1,"plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention  
the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road  
who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  
critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! 
it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around  
a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 
a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  
it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop  
this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments  
in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim  
but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t  sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness  
i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here  
in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards  
and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks ! 
there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time  
the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next  
it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works  
the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse  
i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well  
and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? 
no   "

1,"the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy  
but after diasappointing films such as "" godzilla "" and "" fear and loathing in las vegas "" , it would be nice to see a really good film  
but i doubt you could have expected this  
the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the "" decade's best "" list  
there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , "" yes , that's what makes this film great  "" 
the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically  
there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show  
it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect  
carrey has made a very wise choice  
by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side  
that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes  
truman burbank was born to an audience of millions  
he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show  
everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris )  
everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra  
they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life  
but he is the only person that is not aware of it  
the classification of the truman show may be tricky  
the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter  
i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character "

1,"trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter  
the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present  
sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry  
gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers  
he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty'  
what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife  
suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires  
dave and gerald too have problems of their own  
on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club  
there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them  
gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub  
in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men'  
the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all  
it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to  
it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it  
never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way  
while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood  
other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen  
however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying  
carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen "

1,"when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr  
moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt  
the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department  
the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b  demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones  
in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children  
animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh  
let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off  
dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group  
the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying  
like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices  
danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti  
you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god  
the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments  
the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life  
demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice  
at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters  
we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket  
we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh  
moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew "
1,"i have to admit that i disliked this film initially  
it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood  
that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible  
this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year  
perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality  
i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully  
on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it )  
the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of  
it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom  
and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie )  
the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs  
the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes  
the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion )  
they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography  
the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen  
the only problems come during the first and third acts  
malick takes a little too long to get the film started  
although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in  
the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this  
the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times "
1,"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film  
despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence  
ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr  cage  
the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films  
`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause  
but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead'  
cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day  
after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends  
he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york  
frank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow    ' he promises )  
frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance  
the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain  
the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation  
and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood  
i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot  
each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality "
1,"capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end    
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs  
most comedies these days have one flaw  
they're not funny  
they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly  
occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end  
liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny  
this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork  
jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing  
there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away  
but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together  
the son goes with them , of course  
the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality  
then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie  
he gets the wish  
what happens next is sidesplitting  
everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , "" no ! 
i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze ! 
all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! "" 
he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye  
and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture "
1,"matthew broderick and high school comedy  
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986  
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world  
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows  
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean  
but election is far different  
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well  
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud  
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school  
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him  
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl  
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body  
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president

1,"kevin smith is like a big kid  
his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's  
he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few  
he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups  
smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong  
kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that  
that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed  
great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them  
this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well  
that is not to say smith's message is a bad one  
in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's  
basically , dogmatism is bad  
changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not  
this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point  
smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book  
but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc  ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns  
the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon )  
along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid  
fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery "
1,"david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head  
it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future  
the story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs  
the world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are "" hiding "" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world  
allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group  
as they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun  
she flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard  
unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged  
to inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her  
the events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist , as the "" players "" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot  
here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective  
i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise , which is structured as a computer game , with "" tasks "" that the characters must complete to win the game  
released after "" the matrix "" and "" dark city "" , "" existenz "" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films  
however , "" existenz "" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own  
a combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made "" the matrix "" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade  
 "" existenz "" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling "" dark city "" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining  
 "" existenz "" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored  
after the engaging beginning , it starts to falter  
while i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour  
and indeed , "" existenz "" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another "
1,"near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down  
he has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls  
standing upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide  
he has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others  
as a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls  
but times and ambitions change  
things happen , and he's stuck  
his guardian angel is there , and shows him that    it's 
a wonderful life  
in a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him  
he learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift  
his earthly problems are solved  
the climatic scene is a marvel  
frank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation  
wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released  
many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly  
but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices  
the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel "
1,"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off  
maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films  
but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film  
it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives  
following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white  
it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne  
cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her  
hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her  
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually  
cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting    
secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? 
that way nobody gets hurt  ""  
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us  
hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter  
one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "" been with a black man "" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her  
at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny  
little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's "" just dropping by "" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation  
maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles "

1,"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
 "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke  
it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome  
that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio  
from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat  
these movies , particularly "" kiki's delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining  
 "" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home  
this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  
her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  
kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to  
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  
on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service  
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  
kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  
they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl "
1,"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- 
summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! 
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis  
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town  
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them  
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee  
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely  
unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh  
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story  
the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master  
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours  
longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] 
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell  
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh  
you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you  
matinee is not like that  
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis  
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film  
but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters  
the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west  
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today  
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally  
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink "

1,"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity  
the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon  
but thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience  
getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin  
gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess  
much to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old  
getting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life  
getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development  
gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche  
we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity  
birdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout  
the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life  
despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer  
for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance  
gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat  
after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life  
helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father  
gavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character  
peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer  
the scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat "
1,"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it  
my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago  
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot  
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year  
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe  
at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo )  
a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed  
cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood  
weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school  
he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom  
the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist  
if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole  
if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense  "" 
anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here  
once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere  
dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole  
malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth  
the box office success of "" the sixth sense "" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so  
i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but "" the sixth sense "" isn't really a horror film  
at its core , "" the sixth sense "" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems "

 ? he wants to sabotage the girls' concert so he can sell papers  
of course , the point in a movie like "" spice world "" isn't plot  
 ? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton )  
 ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that can't be said for a lot of people in films today

1,"it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters  
his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie  
the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast  
it is filled with above-the-title stars  
the cast , for the most part , gives great performances  
john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve  
george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance  
one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration  
the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic  
these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick  
terrence malick is a cinematic legend  
he has often been called "" the j  d  salinger of cinema  "" 
his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures  
after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years  
this film marks his return  
what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment  
the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as "" i'm scared  "" 
the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted "
1,"in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy  
some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before  
this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through  
making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year  
what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences  
the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness  
chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion  
the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens  
many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business  
on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does  
also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends  
juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses  
lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs  
judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin  
carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously  
victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down  
a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie  "" 
that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne  
the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film  
cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules "
1,"the postman delivers but not first class 
the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 
[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner  
even worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable  
read the following with those particular grains of salt  ] 
it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart  
due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms  
although this is the future , it looks like a western  
as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company  
giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders  
running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton )  
the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the "" clan "" 
after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes  
taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either  
once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the "" restored congress of the united states of america ""  
this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants  
food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile  
shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item  
although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through  
the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny  
the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner  
although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted  
it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns "
1,"kadosh means sacred in hebrew  
amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one  
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government  
gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel  
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view  
that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are  
the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel  
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief  
it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go  
the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance  
the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace  
the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god  
he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman  
his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom  
she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv  
meir is a talmudic scholar  
his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva  
he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child  
since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage  
she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead "
1,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again  
there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice  
 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon  ' "" 
of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  
you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience  
experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  
trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  
juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan  
a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka )  
goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious  
goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen  
the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing  
however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy  
this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems  
take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner  
the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum  
tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room  
she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists  
just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door  
she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience "
1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j  e  freeman , as well as the little-seen dr  gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and    winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up )  
there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship "

1,"i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club  
a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown  
in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances  
mrs  
doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet  
while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs  
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy  
williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  
one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce  
unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper  
he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman  
daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  
mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so  
the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable  
it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle  
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's  
perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  
there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask "
1,"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal  
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times  
under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet  
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  
in other words , the sound sucked  
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film  
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together  
there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review  
which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing  
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix  
it is nothing short of stunning visually  
sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good  
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked  
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax  
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster  
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network  
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed  
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose "
1,"studio expectations must not have been high for "" great expectations "" -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999  
it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year  
 "" great expectations "" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's "" william shakespeare's romeo + juliet  "" 
 "" great expectations "" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future  
there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms  dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of  
finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms  dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion  
flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art  
there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world  
when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction  
but she's not the only ghost from finn's past that's going to be paying him a visit  
comparisons with the afore-mentioned "" romeo + juliet "" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting  
 "" great expectations "" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where "" romeo "" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both  
the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes  
the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik  
acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups  
hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from "" gattaca "" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy  
paltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped  
while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire "

1,"in one scene from "" the people vs  
larry flynt , "" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally  
as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity  
the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in "" patton "" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag  
both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies  
overall , that sums up "" the people vs  
larry flynt  "" 
the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie  
the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati  
there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life  
to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine  
flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt  
they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on "" what guys really want , "" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor  
the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's "" naughtiness  "" 
director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons  
flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives  
an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law  
lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife  
norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior  
in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell "
1,"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made  
i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot  
2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science  
most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting  
the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town  
something bad happens to them  
pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight  
apparently everyone in the town is dead  
the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada  
two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins  
some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive  
they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb  
what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows  
their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict  
what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet  
they barely call off the bombing in time  
but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out  
this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb  
to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow  
much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts "
1,"bill condon's "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics "" frankenstein "" and "" bride of frankenstein  "" 
since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations  
whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him  
as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l  a  , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home  
james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man  "" 
in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing  
because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off  
clayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past  
certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis  
 "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a "" motion picture director , "" rather than a "" horror director  "" 
and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore  
it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life  
as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself  
he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person  
through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life  
although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him  
since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor  
although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness "
1,"i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review  
i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it  
quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that  
they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either  
a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr  
strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that  
that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them  
the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office  
the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood  
brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u  s  is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor  
as i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy  "" 
another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village  
the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt  
william "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho  
of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis  
still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable  
regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? 
the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt  
schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it "
1,"upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises  
i'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen  
yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters  
director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters  
the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family  
there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home  
squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history  
perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness  
no situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems  
this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play  
the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright  
what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa  
in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness  
legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster  
only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble  
in the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter  
the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite  
he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance  
drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous  
the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change "

just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time

1,"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen  
nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's "" pulled back in "" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi )  
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang  
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well  
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits  
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects  
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride  
and what follows doesn't disappoint    
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way    
good or bad    
i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely  
of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class  
also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday

1,"at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : "" can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? "" 
fucking good question , that  
it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history  
yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick  
the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking  
pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream  
and live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder

soon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing  
 "" never do your own stash "" , warns one character early in the film  
as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls  
writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here  
stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development  
montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience  
a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits  
pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting  
pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life  
only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige  
this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well  
as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva  
the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola "
1,"after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit  
spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space  
with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit  
star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative  
remember , the robot ? 
it wasn't one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit  "" 
the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors  
the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk  
cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool  "" 
upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop  
and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes  
as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid  
even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them  
 "" if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three  
turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend  
with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy  
spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker  
stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus  "" 
this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment  
the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget  
the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing "
1,"although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right  
billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro  ) 
ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help  
but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out  
all done in a comic fashion , of course  
although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride  
billy crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act  
he's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny  
robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny  
he's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine  
lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t  v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen  
the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli  ) 
the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking  
it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in  
spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather  
the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun  
there's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason  
it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script  
unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know "
1,"after a stylistic detour with mrs  
parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption  
while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie  
it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it  
until mrs  
parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies  
i found equinox , his last pre- mrs  
parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating  
i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow  
there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach  
the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch  
in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in  
afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples  
jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle )  
for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level  
all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating  
after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor  
the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne  
a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart  
they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs "
1,"if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? 
 "" gattaca "" is a film which presents a future where society has answered "" yes "" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision  
 "" gattaca "" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening  
the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true  
contrary to the misleading trailers , "" gattaca "" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes  
this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories  
in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children )  
it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what "" gattaca "" presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years  
as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired  
vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! )  
but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( "" wings "" ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : "" men in black , "" "" a life less ordinary ""    ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled  
fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life  
since vincent looks a bit like him  "

the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury 109  
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison  
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons "
1,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death  
this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next    
chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue  
the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr  boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all  
when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit    
and in what room , and with what object  
while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments  
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends  
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go  
the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs  white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest  
and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well  
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video  
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer "
1,"american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid  
its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member  
jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time  
after a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to "" lose it "" by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away  
american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds  
almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee  
all women are there to be ogled  
 ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch  ) 
situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys  
 ( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence  
to amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie  ) 
what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys  
two more standouts : klein and "" sctv "" 's eugene levy  
klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne's underappreciated election  
i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon  
levy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow  
american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up  
it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds' "" don't you ( forget about me )  "" 
the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie's protagonists first whip out a condom  
the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible "
1,"bruce willis is a type-casted actor  
in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time  
again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes  
in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time  
a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914  
an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the "" 5 elements "" are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back  
cut to present day , which is our future  
the year is 2023 , and new york is the city  
the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats ! 
anyway , the "" evil "" comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the "" 5 elements "" to earth , in order to defend themselves against the "" evil  ""

1,"i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" , wilder's "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick's "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies "

1,"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue  
kieslowski's blue , that is  
with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release  
language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length  
as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant  
alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope ""  
while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt )  
when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her  
following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil  
events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability  
in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult  
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues  
in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art  
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? 
are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? 
myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context  
through louisa's struggles , she succeeds  
while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination  
even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention  
the cinematography is stunning  
city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions  
later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground "
1,"this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated  
there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story  
this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 )  
this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story  
in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives ""  
one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him  
woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards  
later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room  
since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back  
although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale  
the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup  "" 
if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit  
so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend  
and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr  potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys  
there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader )  
meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar )  
they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan  
he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations  
the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage "
1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington  
washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar  
jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals  
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter  
through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted  
the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya )  
when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned  
flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison  
the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer  
lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal  
 "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington  
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly  
it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be  
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film "
1,"one of the best movies i've ever seen  
i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now  
for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u  s  it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records  
after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? 
the strength of this film is it's gritty realism  
the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes  
you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real  
i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken  
even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase  
and the ending       whoa  
i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly  
the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific  
the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there "
1,"frequency n  , 
the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc 
don't worry  
when watching the thriller frequency , you won't have to know what the heck frequency means  
the premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen  
a new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago  
immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse  
when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn't supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john's mother and nine other women  
it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place  
 ( i told you that wasn't confusing ? )  
overall , i was very pleased with frequency  
it's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes  
i usually don't buy those cheesy "" i love you dad "" segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me  
maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative  
frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ? 
what would i do ? 
would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ? 
or stop some kids from shooting other kids ? 
or buy stock from yahoo ! ? 
 ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences )  
frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future  
both share that "" change the past slightly , and you'll change the future heavily "" warning  
the changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar  
both are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations  
the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making  
there are some problems with the film though "
1,"in december of 1996 , a little movie called "" scream , "" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens  
first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both "" scream "" movies , "" i know what you did last summer , "" "" urban legend , "" etc  ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's "" can't hardly wait  "" 
it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : "" varsity blues , "" "" jawbreaker , "" "" cruel intentions , "" "" simply irresistible , "" "" the rage : carrie 2 , "" and "" the mod squad  "" 
coming april 9 are two more of this type : "" never been kissed "" and "" go , "" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire "" election "" and the teen horror-comedy "" idle hands  "" 
jeesh ! 
out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that  "" 
although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club  "" 
and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she's all that ? "" )  
the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik )  
although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to  
kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger )  
complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey  
as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union )  
at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" )  
since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained  
aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot  
aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings  
as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the '60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her  
even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality  
no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does "
1,"james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok  
for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race  
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed  
however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor  
to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born  
in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn  
images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film  
even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines  
in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star  
in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy  
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it  
unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse  
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la  
children watch the flames in a burning television  
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him  
even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence  
all sara can do is await it  
 ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) 
the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too  
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place  
back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) "
1,"in `enemy at the gates' , jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad  
it's world war ii , and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland  
law's vassili is the russian's top pawn to victory  
lots of war stuff happens  
an older , german version of jude's character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings  
he's equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other  
they constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background  
the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov 
the set-up is decent , and so are the production values  
boasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers  
the actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan'  
either their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean  
with dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action  
that said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i don't think ed harris was really trying  
maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom  
while the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes  
director jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not going to die , it's relatively pointless  
we get that he's talented , okay , let's move on  
that's the problem with `enemy at the gates' ; it just doesn't know when to stop  
witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere  
reestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film , jude law carries the movie "
1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you "
1,"synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband  
after uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers  
comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time  
though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it  
it is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence  
this film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory  
for those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour  
nicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities  
as tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants  
serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california  
california , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character  
the real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare  
stormare played the "" really , really evil guy "" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable  
his performance is very chilling  
8 mm's success may hardly be surprising  
it was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin  
before directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down  
8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes  
8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back  
like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater "

1,"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church 
synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy  
in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids  
to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e  f  as the apostle e  f  sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station  
soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple  
but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him  
opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms  
i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film  
duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs  
incidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway  
since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars )  
in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film  
similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience  
on the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience  
in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone  
teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church  
in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience "
1,"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid's point of view is , in a word , "" dark ""  
you wouldn't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson's novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal  
jekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate  
mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times  
director stephen fears' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them  
the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white  
the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid  
scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry  
 ( except there's no red , of course  ) 
the look is so moody and melodramatic that you'll be shocked when you leave the theater  
i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward  
often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts  
here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless  
his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience  
two parts that make up a whole  
neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable  
the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude  
when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands  
roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles  
both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film "
1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place "
1,"like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art  
it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence  
why is this such a good film ? 
there are almost too many reasons to explain  
the story : court composer salieri ( f  
murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer  
salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious  
we travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise  
the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language  
this performance earned him a well deserved oscar  
tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh  
he's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth  
jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm  
the movie : every element of this movie works  
the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music )  
while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking  
this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come

1,"the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u  s  distribution , thanks to first run features  
although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers  
set in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa )  
as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet  
earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child  
when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children  
nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son )  
bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with  
leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing  
there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration  
almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  
maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  
leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances  
one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply  
it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  
although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  
ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  
these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman "
1,"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences  
you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies  
oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century  
as gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind  
oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure  
at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun  
i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend  
some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it  
like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all  
sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism  
and isn't that the point of the patriot ? 
gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away  
he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! )  
as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields  
but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich )  
forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army  
the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right  
every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment  
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable  
as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done  
clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating "

1,"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals  
basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother  
qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship  
however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz ! 
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain  
secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions "

strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i  e  
 "" men in black "" )  
what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time  
the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit  
if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness  
in this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it  
we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking  
this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? 
that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election  
brean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman )  
they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it )  
soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play  
we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary )  
the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news  
the characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque  
for example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee  
motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs "
1,"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere ""  
the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback ""  
lebowski's passion is bowling  
when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him  
arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse , they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor  
the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there  
when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine "

1,"every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks  
now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films  
so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda  
see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video  
see the best film i have seen in 1996  
not the best children's film    the 
best film  
period  
based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict  
the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books  
when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris )  
but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness  
matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty  
it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda  
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito  
devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images  
in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert  
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale "
1,"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie  
action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle  
for fans of both genres , however , realism is key  
action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end  
on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr  
moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin  
the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years  
the script , written by j  d  zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago  
a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times  
frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck  
his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it  
robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time  
he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package  
the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik  
at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk  
fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened  
the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews  
the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness "
1,"renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 )  
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts  
he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort  "" 
the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage  
it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion  
what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring  
yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs  
also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors  
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there  
it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness  
they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts  
she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi )  
she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family  
simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays  
simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view  
screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts  
jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph  d  
in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru  ' 
she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control "
1,"a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite  
they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too  
they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb  
men in black is a four-star three-star film  
 ( hope you could follow that one ) 
men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun  
just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use  
after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ? 
men in black is , of course , the organization which "" moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth ""  
nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes  
the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof  
naturally nobody believes his story  
  
  
nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of  
edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib  
edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints )  
james edwards no longer exists

1,"this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday  
jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin  
as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him  
he has become an unquestioning weapon  
he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is  
but even assassins have innocent pasts  
he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school  
complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime  
a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin  
calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us  
he was seen in the world is not enough  
here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years  
he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake  
his lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats  
it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life  
paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness  
by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world  
this is a world that is cold and unfriendly  
sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see  
this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach "
1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length  
amazingly , he was right  
titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it  
the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  
fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams  "" 
the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story  
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  
using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  
after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  
in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast  
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  
even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  
in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board "

wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  
everyweek , wafflemovies  com 
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  
here is a sample review : 
welcome to sarajevo 
in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  
set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  
as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  
joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know  
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane )  
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest  
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  
during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance  
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope "
1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) "
1,"clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another  
midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn't even in , and it's damn good  
adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head  
and that's just the mayor  
as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor  
like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion  
the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you'd expect , but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm  
cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey's parties  
lots of food , beverages and gunplay  
yes , an employee of spacey's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead  
it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in  
the weird circle of entertainment  
this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in  
there's the requisite sexy woman ( alison "" nepotist's daughter "" eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite  
miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? 
chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie  
there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating  
certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury's foreman  
it's here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey's homosexuality  
yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course  
midnight in the garden of good and evil isn't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there "
1,"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight  
the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight  
professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions  
this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but "" good will hunting "" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama  
a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting  
will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle  
he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her  
what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life  
the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong  
lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say  
and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will  
will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious "" right "" and "" wrong "" side and beating them over the head with it  
for a film with such an extraordinary character , "" good will hunting "" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another  
this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation  
 "" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture  
and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa  
will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character  
add all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars  
well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original  
there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions "
1,"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  
luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation  
otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  
in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times  
those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film  
like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  
perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away  
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  
anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  
and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic  
star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment )  
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  
until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies  
as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood  
serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy  
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre "

how much longer can the works of peckinpah , fassbinder , fuller , castle , preminger , and lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections of the local blockbuster stores ? 
how many more silver and weinstein films can we enduring in this stinky , decaying state of american cinema ? 
but now , from john "" i don't give a shit what you think about my movies "" waters , comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and aficionados : cecil b  demented , a warped and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social revolution  
stephen dorff , in a career-defining role , is cecil b  demented , a crazed director devoted to making the most radical underground film  
together with his film production cult , the sprocket holes - who wear tattoos of peckinpah , lee , fuller , castle , anger , fassbinder , preminger on various parts of their bodies as badges of honor , they kidnap a hollywood movie starlet , played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith , and force her to take the starring role in demented's film  
with no budget and no contracts for extras , demented and his crew take to the streets for production of raving beauty , a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to destroy the mainstream film business  
using "" ultimate reality "" - with real bullets , real people , and real terror - demented and his crew of misfits attack a mall theater , terrorize the maryland film commission and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying tom hanks film  
demented's crewmembers are maimed and killed , popcorn machines are used for target practice , and no one can have sex until the film is complete  
it's like bowfinger , only , you know , good  
the film moves with zigs and zags like the magic bullet of kennedy's assassination  
the zeal of demented's cause catches quickly and conveys the urgent message of "" doing something , anything , for the accomplishment of artistic motivations  "" 
the crewmembers all hold the quirkiness common in water's previous films - pink flamingos , hairspray , polyester , pecker -- and speak in the choppy , jaded dialogue used frequently by waters  
it is as if water's script strips away the unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods  
cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it might actually outdo itself  
you can see how a major studio might take this film , re-edit it , cut a deal with the remaining crew members who are still alive , and make a few sequels , a la the blair witch project  
but that's for the future "

in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment  
fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation  
while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic  
according to the program notes , it was mr  disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress  
sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released  
it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade  
with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films  
like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience  
ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective  
these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which , along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators , is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis  
fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giant-screened imax theaters , making for a unique viewing experience  
there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely , people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites  
for me , that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who , unknowingly , help each other realize their dreams  
drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwin's rhapsody in blue , the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts  
children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint-saens  
here , a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo-yo playing antics  
they will also giggle as donald duck , playing noah's assistant , tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar  
 ( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7  ) 
a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended "
1,"plot : this movie takes place over one day  
it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran  
the rookie doesn't know much about "" street justice "" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world ""  
how even cops like themselves have to "" bend the rules "" and "" break the law "" every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys  
critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws  
i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place  
the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of , well    the 
dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there  
of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either  
and therein , lies the fun of the film  
do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? 
well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another  
and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades  
hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top  
and denzel , well , what can you say about mr  washington that hasn't already been said before ? 
he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more  
he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way  
the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it  "

1,"it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching  
all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails  
and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? 
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon  
a computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades  
but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it  
instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad  
with the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) 
i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema  
it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed  
of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983  
i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares  
i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon  
broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery )  
but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups  
david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr  strangelove  
if for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days  
david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers  
the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on  
far from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum  
the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today "
1,"when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better  
nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s  
for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids  
for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for  
feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era  
martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all  
the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights  
the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world  
the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign  
their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre  
losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street  
he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict  
that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi  
as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations  
for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times  
for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade  
brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides  
his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence  
his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain  
however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen "
1,"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam  
 ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment  ) 
while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt  
maj  archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune  
these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles  
our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs  
they are gates , new father sgt  
troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt  
chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt  
conrad vig ( music video director jonze )  
at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends  
barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion  
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy  
so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help  
 ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause  ) 
gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges "
1,"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics  
it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story  
all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal  
we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be  
oh well  
it's still an excellent irish story  
 "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over  
first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail  
while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together  
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again  
and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in  
they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon  
but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things  
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself  
we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times  
there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty  
the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship  
there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant  
they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times  
and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape "
1,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp  
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity  
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste  
 , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way  
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law  
during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war  
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal  
when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal  
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output  
while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27%  
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad  
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do  
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day  
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll  
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany  
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese  
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps  
certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai  
there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it  
then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko "

1,"saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes  
starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie  
it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998  
tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action  
action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him  
after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie  
i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes  
tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 )  
this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it  
occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance  
edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today  
spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes  
and what battle scenes they are ! 
they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen  
the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique  
the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting  
this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults  
other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making  
the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb  
it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen  
but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing "
1,"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible  
people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred  
five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation  
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry  
as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe  
in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution  "" 
each of the five tells his or her story  
their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary  
they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps  
they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope  
each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation  
and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps  
needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining  
by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five  
the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage  
in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration  
the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days  
it's not clear which scene it is  
it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful  
one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars "
1,"the premise is simple , if not bizarre  
a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr  clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j  nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made  
why ? 
it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun  
based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely  
mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies  
the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr  forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live  
dr  forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t  robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema  
the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man  
we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them  
in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth  
we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary  
the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one  
this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth  
together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet  
to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty "
1,"insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america  
as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold  
throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism  
parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! 
musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut )  
apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- "" south park "" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! 
also offers up some pretty decent laughs  
the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note )  
stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap  
jason mchugh's character of mr  miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings  
as i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy  
you'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every "" south park "" episode is scored with a few notes from this song )  
other songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale )  
thankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are  
released as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd  
the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball )  
there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films  
as for the dvd    
well , that's a different story "
1,"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s  
for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects  
but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  
and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars ""  
the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  
the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 )  
in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  
although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack )  
murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  
through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  
braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  
however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  
the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  
while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish  
this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood  
compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  
braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics  
what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist  
mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero "
1,"it's terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office  
these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama  
additionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist  
and where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary  
i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits  
adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath  
he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there  
finally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? "" 
apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike "" the sixth sense , "" this young child isn't the focus of the picture  
instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist  
jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife  
one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him  
it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months  
seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door  
she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees  
 "" stir of echoes "" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family  
kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's "" dream with the fishes "" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems  
after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit  
bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet  
in a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness  
lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater "
1,"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild  
yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen  
mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties  
ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) 
spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times  
fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms  austen originally penned in her novel  ) 
writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes  
from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal  
what ms  rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms  austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny  
the result is a central character that is immediately appealing  
as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work  
at times , ms  rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations  
this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms  o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr "
1,"synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york  
disco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy  
in fact , they're terrified  
as in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring  
the cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam  
no one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe  
all around new york people are different  
aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals  
in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino )  
vinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know  
ritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut  
everyone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as "" alien "" to the community  
unfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor  
opinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer  
nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him  
it's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion  
one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex  
in other movies sex is glamorized  
for example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning  
or boring made-for-video "" suspense "" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake "

his american buffalo is a set-bound piece that has very little plot  
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves  
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work  
unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility  
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games  
it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double-crossing the viewer  
watching the film's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either "" what the heck are they doing ? "" 
or "" why didn't anybody think of that before ? "" 
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job  
it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films  
this is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine  
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera  
now joe has to get out of the business  
it was coming time anyway  
joe's team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) , fran moor ( rebecca pidgeon ) , and pinky pincus ( ricky jay ) is going to split up and go separate ways

and he has to take along a young kid , the short- fused jimmy silk ( sam rockwell )  
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye  
much of what distinguishes heist is mamet's dialog  
remarkably it serves a double purpose  
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet's special feel for dialog "

nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )

1,"the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment  
 "" mulan , "" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point  
once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years )  
add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits  
bob's your uncle ! 
better make that walt's your uncle    
kids will no doubt go ga-ga over "" mulan "" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more  
maybe an animated feature without--shock ! 
horror ! --the 
songs , for example ? 
or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? 
how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? 
it isn't gonna happen  
like disney's previous entries , "" mulan "" is slow to make its mark  
the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought  
however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks  
highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( "" i'll make a man out of you , "" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself

1," "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition "" 
in 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot  
28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years  
director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition  "" 
the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica  
as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land  
for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety  
shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island  
once on this "" safe "" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization  
he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia  
miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours  
this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen  
in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war  
the title of this fascinating documentary , "" the endurance , "" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world  
it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth  
the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather  
it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men  
with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey  
the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow  
after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on  
considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself "
1,"my filmcritic  com 
colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's  
it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern  
genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i  e  , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues )  
in a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents  
much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here  
is boyish , eccentric "" sam deed from dubuque , iowa "" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ? 
as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted  
the question proves to be moot , at least for a time  
even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : "" he's a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! "" 
neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc  ) , but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities  
 ( don't ask  ) 
it's all a bit much to take in  
ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship  
who ya gonna believe ? 
despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents  
her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "" cute "" to her adoring fans  
being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal "" substantial and sexy  "" 
it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality  
then there's that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable "
1,"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction  
the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun  
sometimes the stories are compelling  
sometimes they're not  
but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions  
star trek : insurrection is no exception  
the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why  
it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film  
some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film  
others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring  
i simply enjoyed the film  
insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet  
of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f  
murray abraham ) , to mess everything up  
the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying  
that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) )  
so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat  
when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode  
this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it  
insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters "

1," "" if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too  "" 
starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus 
in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy  
in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals  
but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge  
crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version  
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven  
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots  
before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years  
in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan  
the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little  
within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways  
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale  
i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong  
and there are ways in which it does  
the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales  
the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes  
probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable  
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness  
one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen  
part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind "
1,"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly  
event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me  
it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner  
the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying  
the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed  
the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime  
the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune  
a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon  
the designer of the ship , dr  weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship  
event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be  
while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying  
the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! 
i can't stand this anymore ! '  
there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime  
the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards  
even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board )  
director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror'  
this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this  
although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus  
however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing "

be forewarned  
east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films  
an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential  
though not for lack of trying  
in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat  
the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? 
in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending  
the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace )  
dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence  
while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory  
the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land  
at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage  
as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity  
scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation  
mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour  
it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry  
off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief  
they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity  
at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang  
everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film "
1,"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues  
 "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time  
 "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike  
hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine  
after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception  
he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food  
after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts  
because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy  
realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr  ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time  
it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security  
he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger  
meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind  
 "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience  
the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy  
it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e  t  , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant  "" 
the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy  
the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate "

seen july 4 , 1999 at 7 : 15 p  m  at crossgates cinemas 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #9 , by myself for free using my hoyts season pass  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture and seats] 
title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow  
review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story  
the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends  
the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism  
her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family  
he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts  
i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this  
later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof  archimedes q  porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed )  
it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment  
sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' )  
there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks  
it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point )  
ultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect "
1,"the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily  
three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making  
they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house  
from there , things become a little more complicated  
i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me  
although i know it was all a staged "" mockumentary "" , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you  
i didn't feel much upon initially watching it  
i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts  
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend  
i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then  
this is not a movie that hits you right away  
instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind  
this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch  
the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work  
this is as real as it gets folks  
i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera  
the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not  
this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera  
the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen  
word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release "
1,"1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included )  
hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap  
despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two  
writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film  
that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her  
alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death  
what could be next ? 
whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna  
so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude  
unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops  
the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features  
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought  
the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them  
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy  
while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon  
the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so  
the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence  
the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji  
as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series  
a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun  
no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law  
a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama  
floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family  
the film opens with mr  and mrs  chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia  
with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one  
this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy  
the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone  
floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family  
meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under  
among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch  
the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia  
emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective  
his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious  
ms  law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life  
floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters "
1,"for a movie about disco-era excess , "" 54 "" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club  
think of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , "" 54 "" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination  
it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either  
in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , "" 54 "" would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle  
studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986  
inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did  
the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines  
his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course  
once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs  
he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy  
he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own  
after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54  
but fame doesn't come without a price  
 "" 54 "" 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act  
alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since "" 54 "" sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there  
nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar  
the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special  
that "" 54 "" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled  
sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision  
the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( "" the wedding singer "" 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a "" funky little treat "
1,"eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career  
known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years  
with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback  
life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel  
director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up  
life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other  
amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other  
as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club  
there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence )  
somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run  
when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff  
hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan  
the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude  
luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner  
not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too  
murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards  
this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve  
while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core  
but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars  
the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance "
1,"in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name  
he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe  
burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror  
writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine  
as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood'  
landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider  
after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate  
landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods  
crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie )  
first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film  
as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly  
the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors  
but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ? 
although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right   
it was the light comic touch that burton applied  
the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities  
this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made  
as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves  
the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved  
it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive "
1,"an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material  
the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation  
instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice  
upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days  
of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries  
in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi )  
rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando  
i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips  
but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread  
ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world  
throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective

co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done "
1,"after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house  
the review 
two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense  
each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising  
if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two  
writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit  
the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party  
while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head  
things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses  
where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you  
david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom's house or just down the street  
by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc  )  
unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity  
humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting  
several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes  
also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away  
kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably  
his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie  
kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most "" wife who can no longer handle her husband "" parts  
while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls "" a private club that i'm not invited to "" , where they whisper about things all day long "
1,"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies  
from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy  
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves  
shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time  
sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d  a  
pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience  
no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul  
the excitement starts before the music even begins  
a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so  
there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick  
and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! "" 
you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street  
this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience  
it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain  
and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love  
even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats  
the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal  
all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time  
in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time  
for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating "

1,"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
directed by robert altman 
some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director ? 
francis ford coppola  
the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather  
the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history  
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask  
but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people  
like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon  
>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone "
1," "" sometimes the 'green mile' seems sooooo long  "" 
indeed  
and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review  
on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length  
the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to "" old sparky , "" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935  
paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you've got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row  
keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility  
it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they "" talk to "" the convicts instead of yelling at them  
this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars  
into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls  
immediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner  
perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark  
or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he "" takes back "" paul's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health  
based on steven king's 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner "" fry "" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he's witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor  
while it is mr  hanks "" everyman "" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting  
all involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr  duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization  
if only the story were more credible  
writer/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power "
1,"not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility  
while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement  
jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia  
on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer  
here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia  
strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity  
later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life  
one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good  
it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison  
he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don't talk about fight club  "" 
armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees  
resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla  
funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem  
their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour  
it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist  
it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting  
it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out  
fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people  
in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it  
i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone "
1,"as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat  
they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen

saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film  
the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar  
the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding  
but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen  
the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get  
the question is , "" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? "" 
the answer from my point of view is "" no ""  
braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film  
ryan is ten times worse  
expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield  
many in the theater could not bear to watch  
and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year  
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) "
1,"[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap  
as it happens , it didn't take long  ] 
is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? 
known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria  
last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature  
it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen  
at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance  
the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused  
the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery  
the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus  
it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace  
in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea  
after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? 
what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead  
who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a "" lethal weapon "" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? 
franco zeffirelli , that's who  
and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money  
what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible  
his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed  
his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character  
this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end  
glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written  
 ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help "

1,"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before  
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen  
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd  
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes  
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source  
if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes  
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? 
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end  
it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision  
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case  
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium  
upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach  
i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay  
in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end  
it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts  
and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" )  
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it  
now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 )  
the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic  
oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place  
even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent "
1,"while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him  
as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off  
when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake  
the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted  
he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die  
alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious "" suicide "" of a friend , and a mortician ( tony "" candyman "" todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims  
in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death's new plan and thwart it  
of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the "" scream "" audience , "" final destination "" is the best so far  
talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula  
we've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes the villain death itself  
first-time feature director james wong made the most of that premise  
every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime  
everyday objects and events vibrate with menace  
the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver's "" rocky mountain high , "" which is played several times in the movie before someone dies  
 ( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky  ) 
the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror  
devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , "" idle hands , "" gives a frantic and convincing lead performance  
kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane  
smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence  
seann william scott , who's also in theaters right now in "" road trip , "" plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter "

in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech  
at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers  
she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in  
drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there  
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here  
in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken  
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from  
the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister  
it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie  
the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls  
with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui )  
he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls  
the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship  
it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home  
things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village  
it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there  
this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also  
but i doubt that  
the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel "

maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject  
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red  
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life  
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware  "" 
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths  
the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either  
writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train  
the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family  
as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals  
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit  
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day  
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform  
in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station  
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty  
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) "
1,"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo  
two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides  
this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba  "" 
patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject  
peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader  
we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men  
images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image  
jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo  
a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader  
his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville  
at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc  
as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto )  
the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more  
lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government  
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination  
the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad  
this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries  
peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's  
 ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them  
some colonial masters were better than others "
1,"luckily , some people got starship troopers  
some people knew it was supposed to be silly  
for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 
from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  
i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor  
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned  
first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up  
meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers ""  
four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country  
johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot  
dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for  
if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine  
the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture  
 ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters )  
right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time  
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits  
with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home  
well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it  
that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy  
with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs  
what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc "
1,"there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell  
in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality  
all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future  
motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative  
the "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter  
the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged  
she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover  
one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast  
from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent  
the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses  
how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added  
there are probably too many characters  
so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives  
we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible  
there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband  
the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger  
there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt  
the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly  
while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous  
there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing "

1,"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco  
however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films  
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy  
i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available  
director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s  
this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story  
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete  
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette  
burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner  
horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l  a  home  
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better  
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable  
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his  
as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door  
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l  a  's hardcore film scene "
1,"you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith'  
it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on  
as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio  
while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded  
but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away  
now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs  
the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi  
on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad'  
in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory  
everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums  
now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again  
with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters  
predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b  
edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear'  
after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice  
not in the least  
norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg  
weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut  
in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence  
stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity "
1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year  
it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written  
it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love  
joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc  )  
he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson )  
shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work  
he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel  
this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth )  
shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo  
he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex  
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed  
shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter  
i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care  
he practically overflows with passion in every scene  
fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in  
the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh "
1,"it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film  
i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see  
but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon  
i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell  
i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
i needn+t have worried  
+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_  
surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers  
they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy  
the plot is typical  
thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom  
as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized  
why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty  
he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon )  
he becomes one of the great comic villains  
upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped  
it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself  
would the geek get the girl ? 
puh-lease  
the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there  
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs  
the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame "
1,"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel  
beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action  
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  
as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  
fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel  
lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  
 ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood  ) 
visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy  
fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them  
as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence  
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner  
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors  
most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging  
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie  
sheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside  
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence  
those anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale  
and there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum  
the rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him "
1,"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul  
the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman  
you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings  
we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes  
in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry  
shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton )  
when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time  
they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done  
as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape  
the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall )  
in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all  
gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles  
in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center  
and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation  
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop    just 
because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "" 
the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time  
hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them  
a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments "
1,"october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed "" uplifting "" film that is actually uplifting ! 
based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream  
it's 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there's not much hope of a rosy future  
coalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine  
but , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream  
the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel  
of course , homer's parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren't quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests  
homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair  
and so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket  
but , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ? 
there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky  
nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched  
however , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times  
a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness  
jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film  
>from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience  
unfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick  
they remain little more than placeholders reading "" insert friend here ""  
of the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character  
the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is  
director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge  
however , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far "

1,"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no  
personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies  
i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick  
the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me , there's plenty of it  
a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire  
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted  
cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties  
one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today  
i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home  
that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs  ryan  
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good  
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders  
if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different  
there'd be a phony , "" let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! ""

this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  "" 
then all hell breaks loose in new york  
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians  
a broadway theater is bombed  
hostages are taken at a school  
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil

rated r  
filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell  
the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy  
instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed  
based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights  
the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words  
when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to "" blame canada , "" wage war against the neighbor country and execute "" terrence and phillip , "" the flatulent actors in the obscene film  
the kids form an alliance they name "" la resistance "" ( with the accent on the third syllable of "" resistance "" ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? )

in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) 
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan  
satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see  
satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex  
apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth  
aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like "" shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er "" and "" cartman's mom is a big fat bitch ""  
almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny

1,"kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue  
all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking  
 "" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas's finest performances  
he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night  
the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in  
the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there  
the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate  
however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of  
many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film  
secrets i would not dream of giving away  
with a name like "" detective story "" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of "" nypd blue "" , but it doesn't quite work out that way  
however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time  
lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting  
her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs  
the performances all around are fantastic  
douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time  
we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases  
which brings me back to douglas  
he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him  
we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father "
1,"the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films  
well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty  
the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry  
the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? "" 
the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times )  
the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day  
ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore  
ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage  
katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned  
the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks  
as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage  
this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart  
through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters  
the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom  
the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must  
if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture  
bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script  
although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season  
where to start about michelle pfeiffer ? 
pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism  
pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film  
the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked "
1,"tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end  
all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie  
if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie  
it's hilarious  
how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? 
easy  
write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick  
will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day  
at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to  
the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss  
the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury  
their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury  
grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris  
what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever  
the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive  
the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive  
it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump  
one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will 
and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away  
an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women  
it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now  
ted "" unabomber "" 
kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie "
1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers  "
1,"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies  
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes  
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children  "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children  
picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges  
periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over  
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment  
they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured  
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again  
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss  
ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery  
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness  
his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf  
if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot  
the story unfolds slowly and always believably  
each little aspect has its own fascination "
1,"in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship )  
now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever  
but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president  
it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics  
jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination  
he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson )  
the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign  
he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney )  
governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage  
to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby "" the dustbuster "" holden ( kathy bates )  
the acting throughout primary colors is superb  
it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone  
she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance  
travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little  
emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run  
the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom  
primary colors treads lightly on this issue  
though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues  
in fact , most of the "" bad guys "" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house  
rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control "
1,"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place  
critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this  
a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time  
in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer  
his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch  
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it  
metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again  
that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all  
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg  
wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me )  
he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through  
he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams  
aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes  
i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members  
it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film )  
just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances  
oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! 
you see    dreams 
can come true "
1,"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit  
death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example )  
and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had  
scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously  
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise  
the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time  
a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber  
as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original  
paradoxically , there's a lot less gore  
there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails  
craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids  
a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter  
after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little  
scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original  
as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue  
this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream )  
some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters )  
shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders  
craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences  
they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache "
1,"all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly  
beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo  com , 
an online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour  
designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon  com  
by december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention  
the company was set for an ipo in may 2000    
until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era  
by april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations  
unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup  com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations  
the contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing  
the film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming  
the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise  
the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses  
in the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls  
in the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe

synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility  
 "" paulie the talking parrot "" ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story  
as a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment  
by attending marie's speech lessons , paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person  
unfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold  
paulie's biggest wish is to return to marie  
many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry  
he is sent to a cruel research facility , where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement  
will misha help paulie get back to marie ? 
opinion : every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well-meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular  
soon enough , "" birthday kid "" loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect  
my sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant  
please think twice before buying one  
okay  back to the story  
in movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing  
paulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human  
actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer )  
paulie is for kids  
while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a "" stupid furball  ""

1,"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents  
it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century  
stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house  
the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done  
at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal  
he is simply trying to tame it  
but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them  
stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon  
he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own  
 "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws  
there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking  
sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president  
joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette  
she is strong and loyal as mrs  nixon  
the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j  t  walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins

1,"jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back  
the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout  
in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year  
 ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you  ) 
in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie  
it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent  
jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it  
jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen  
among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , "" action ! "" 
best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies  
the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was "" stupid "" enough to buy tickets to this movie  
 ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory  ) 
the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet  
guilty  
although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them  
it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny  
jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize  
his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything  
but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success  
his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems  
the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) "
1,"krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy  
done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema  
however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works  
professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble  
his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea  
however , he found    nothing  
his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner )  
tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe  
rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids )  
however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon  
soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members  
his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin )  
krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief  
no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes  
luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by  
though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies  
the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb "
1,"devotees of robert a  heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire  
the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version  
and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results  
heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment  
outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt    aliens in broad daylight  
sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs )  
among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets  
while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from "" beverly hills 90210  "" 
so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? 
for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material  
the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent  
if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it  
it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth  
the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit  
in this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most  
verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era "" why we fight "" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches  
these characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting "
1,"airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making  
after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams  
even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few  
but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! 
remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts  
in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high  
films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits  
there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade  
and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film  
this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean  
  
  
it had to do with bad fish  
airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades  
unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart  
he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty )  
in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working  
unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity  
in the midst of it all , something happens

1," "" gattaca "" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story  
the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction  
this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects  
those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as "" in-valids "" and confined to the lower rung of society  
vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton  
fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation  
everyday , he watches as "" superior "" folk make his fantasy a reality  
determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids  
his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life  
for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card  
because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie  
but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered  
two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal  
even if "" gattaca "" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy  
first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama "" the truman show "" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance  
an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily  
niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way  
when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless  
ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level  
his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill "

1,"robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood  
paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross  
harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight  
when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in  
soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust  
there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon  
james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends  
stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest  
reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend  
giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain  
with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze  
luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony  
twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot  
it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days  
the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber  
however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable  
the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn  
stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher  
there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe  
it's a minor , but irritating , flaw "
1,"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder  
grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento  
boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento  
it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's  
based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer  
visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail  
at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints  
posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins  
a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives  
the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario  
it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration  
the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers  
but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years  
argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences  
effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent  
the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style  
proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers  
the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless  
asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating  
it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts "
1,"i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer  
it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the "" best movie "" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon  
it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it  
from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  
in spawn , it was the "" living room hell "" conclusion at the end  
in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces  
and all of face/off was pretty dang good  
but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  
i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  
and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review  
back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) 
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc  ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots  
okay , that one was pretty pathetic  ) 
few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find  
this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black  
kind of weird , huh ? ) 
all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell  
i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot

1,"an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's  
sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love  
alice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun  
we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco  
whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story  
alice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell  
sevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character  
beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable  
the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining  
the dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces  
for example , there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters  
the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun  
the direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes  
but their are slight flaws with the movie  
firstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80's , the characters are very , very 90's  
the way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them  
although the male hairstyles look slightly 80's , frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed , which is a shame  
also , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag  
the charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter  
the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie "

1,"casting "" doogie howser "" star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of "" starship troopers , "" a hugely entertaining , mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven , who's making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic "" showgirls  "" 
sure , "" starship troopers "" qualifies as cinematic junk food , but that's forgivable when the junk food is this tasty  
everyone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall's onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and "" troopers "" does the job admirably despite its flaws  
for its first hour , "" starship troopers "" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of "" saved by the bell "" and "" g  i  
jane  "" 
in the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up  
but there's temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny's is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon )  
personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny's parents and destroying his home  
our weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good  
but the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy  
the exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans  
once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , "" starship troopers "" really kicks into high gear  
its last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show  
the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point  
it's nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren't too derivative of the titular menace from "" alien  "" 
these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that's all sharp talons and even sharper legs  
they attack in packs of hundreds , and it's a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess  
it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying  
the occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member's death , the final resolution to johnny's love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how "" starship troopers "" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters "
1,"in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes  
this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter  
old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings  
through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand  
what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit  
after all , old ned won't miss it  
rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage  
bannen and kelly are a perfect pair  
one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail  
both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers  
waking ned devine may even be seen as a "" full monty "" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene  
waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films  
the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads  
there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture  
writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters  
scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception  
perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more  
had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films  
it is light , but thought provoking and sweet  
i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film "
1,"originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers  
based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6  5/10 ) , 
starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  
plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia  
the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour  
critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  
this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  
admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  
but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings  
this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7  5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity )  
unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie  
on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me    i 
am not a fan of the musicals ! ! )  
make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights  
and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue  
little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career  
both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture "

i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train  "" 
yet it's almost as good  
it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral

without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves  
 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here  
but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby )  
what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  
in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide )  
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  
there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching  
in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done )  
but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights "
1,"it's an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation )  
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality ? 
what is a sham ? 
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 
reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety  
he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? 
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so "
1,"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection  
the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings  
it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie )  
another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time  
this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch )  
what helps final destination is its unique premise  
unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper  
this being already has predestined when and how you will die  
according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses  
what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it  
the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? 
this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers  
alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors  
alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off  
shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal  
however , death isn't through with them yet  
it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again  
the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while  
some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock  
creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films  
sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining "
1,"if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october  
you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator  
in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them  
the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel  
set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october  
the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection  
the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery  
ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas  
he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean  
is he planning to start world war iii ? 
cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u  s  ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub  
the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid  
baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor  
sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer  
it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , "" ace of spies  "" 
the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u  s  national security adviser  
the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot "
1,"this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation  
mind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series  
the movie is really a stand alone in that regard  
the family robinson    lost in space  
plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future  
a colonization process , if you will  
they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip  
eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are "" lost in space ""  
 "" how do get back to earth ? "" 
is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic  
critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6  5/10 ) from the summer of 1997  
it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance  
admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line  
having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average  
you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls  
unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? 
yawn ! )  
the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face "
1,"sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist 
by fernando vallejo 
starring bob flanagan and sheree rose  
interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia  
produced and directed by kirby dick  
running time : 90 mins  
this film is not rated  
the central themes of "" sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist "" are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life  
its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing  
the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease  
an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , "" sick "" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film  
flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 "" crumb "" , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one  
both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects  
but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures  
behold these works of physical art  
among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board  
flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking  
not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment  
most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her  
 ) 
but the most outstanding thing about "" sick "" is flanagan's relationship with sheree  
brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts "" sick "" into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people  
the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous "
1,"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines  
the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy  
then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released  
it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort  
while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety  
but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically  
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy  
it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been  
the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia  
if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life  
it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick  
it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set  
kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana  
after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar  
the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other  
when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr  brackett  
everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he's gay  "" 
the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop  
the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf "
1,"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work  
this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal  
when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case  
upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st  george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home  
as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed  
did dolores kill her husband ? 
and did she kill her employer ? 
dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller  
consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn  
kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance  
dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time  
she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks  
kathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff  
the rest of the cast is also very good  
jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st  george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey  
david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st  george  
judy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role  
child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive  
the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey "

be forewarned  
 "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 
when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  
this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show  
truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life  
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise  
or so it would seem  
bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life  
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around  
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  
for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  
the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  
balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  
in many ways , mr  niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea  
although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible  
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs "
1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming "
1,"contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place  
we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops  
anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead  
it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment  
jodie foster stars as dr  ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals  
and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth  
after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport  
from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook  
the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power  
the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right  
it would be easy for scripters james v  hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane  
in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults  
the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge  
she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge  
we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far  
contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles  
matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot )  
john hurt is effectively creepy as s "
1,"the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7  5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance  
plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom  
unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) 
caught in his zipper , and misses the big night  
thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her  
once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins  
critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep  
having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics  
this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others  
then again , maybe my expectations were too high  
then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film  
continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together  
this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged  
i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not  
not a good place to be  
having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline  
the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel )  
on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture  
i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting  
also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer "
1,"the characters in "" palmetto "" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce  
this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke  
as far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- "" palmetto "" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming  
it's not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise  
harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he's served a couple of years for a crime he didn't commit  
even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry's first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon )  
while searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire  
rhea proposes a scheme that'll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny )  
 "" you do like risks , don't you , mr  barber ? "" 
rhea alluringly coos  
boys , form a line behind me  
part of "" palmetto "" 's success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in "" leaving las vegas "" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come  
shue's a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish  
the other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( "" kids "" ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in "" bound "" and "" showgirls  "" 
harrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to "" the people vs  larry flynt  "" 
 "" palmetto "" does have its share of grievances  
harrelson's narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon's nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is  
one of the plot's unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he's involved -- could have been played a little better  
there are moments when you question the tone , but it's never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it's been receiving from most other critics "

1,"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen  
as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money  
he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals  
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church  
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses  
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher  
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper  
at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal  
not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears  
he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again  
in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling  
after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple  
re-christening himself as "" the apostle e  f "
1,"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? 
director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland ""  
the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion  
is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? 
does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? 
as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman )  
rather , he is ending it with her  
arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings  
in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving  
it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship  
he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief  
erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin  
to erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a "" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life ""  
eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "" poseurs ""  
alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium  
wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish  
later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away  
the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing  
there are several subplots involving alan  
one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business  
another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track  
a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off  
the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy "
1,"field of dreams almost defies description  
although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie  
although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion  
and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker  
to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it  
in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer  
one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : "" if you build it , he will come  "" 
then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again  
and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights  
 "" if you build it , he will come  "" 
and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates  
and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to "" ease his pain  "" 
ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society  
with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey  
the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role  
costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life  
costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale  
amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas  
in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p  t "
1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena

1,"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel  
that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century  
however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h  g  wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences  
the author , h  g  wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour  
whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages  
instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space  
the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration  
first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own  
the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time  
at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time  
they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future  
at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars  
finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions  
when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines  
but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld  
the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times "
1,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true  
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours  
this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity  
instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  
but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy  
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple  
instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane  
there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors  
blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed  
through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  
haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle  
even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool "

based on the novel by t  coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far  
bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr  john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation

1,"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable  
somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through  
set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil )  
an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr  wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st  cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help  
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr  larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics  
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional  
he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly  
larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people  "" 
such is the result of an insulated upbringing  
though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else

1,"the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed  
even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets  
however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin  
davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years  
with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l  jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative  
needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory  
shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods  
like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue  
the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously  
but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car    
while ice skating ? 
jackson and davis make a good team  
jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction  
as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine  
what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously  
she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation  
this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature  
but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche "
1,"you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk  
the title is generic  
it's meaningless  
and i can't believe it's good business  
when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? 
yuck  
the movie itself deserves your attention  
for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down  
only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution  
much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero  
his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold  
in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target  
 ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released  ) 
this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings  
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow  
here's the rundown  
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double  
turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops )  
alain does some investigating  
he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia  
assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa "

about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation  
he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention  
 "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department  
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite  
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch  
their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical  
following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high  
in this case , it is landing the big kahuna  
they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him  
what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product  
and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each  
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen  
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life  
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ  
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in  
bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion "

1,"apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart )  
director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13  
being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet  
perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc  ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause )   
all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles  
apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident )  
jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon  
suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home    
if they ever reach it  
ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly  
audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space  
also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970  
the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner  
watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film  
a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script  
those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show "
1,"summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner  
for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion  
on this occasion one of the roommates , pete ( ron eldard ) , brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down  
the stranger is zack ( bill paxton ) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan  
nothing could be further from the truth  
after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is , among other things , a racist "" you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble we'd have picked the damn cotton ourselves "" , and an anti-semite  
an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence  
after zack assaults marc ( jonathan penner ) and pete , zack is killed  
the roommates are at odds with what to do  
marc , pete and paulie ( annabeth gish ) immediately wish to call the police  
luke ( courtney b  vance ) and jude ( cameron diaz ) suggest something different  
after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up  
they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide  
when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought  
so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views  
if they all agree that the guest deserves to die , they will poison them and bury them in the back yard  
the back yard fills up rather quickly , its' victims including ( among others ) a right to life extremist , an anti-environmentalist and a homophobe  
by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods  
are they giving the guests a chance ? 
are they even giving them good food anymore ? 
this film is what i like to call a "" hidden treasure "" "
1,"go's is a gloriously slick hip machine  
director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l  a  , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them  
after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending  
this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive  
a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories  
the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough  
her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas  
zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust  
perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; 
pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last  
torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was "" not pleased with "" her turn as the ill-fated cashier  
in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date  
here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms  polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you  
if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said "" no , "" not go  
but i digress  
go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride  
in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial )  
i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous "
1,"bruce willis and sixth sense director m  night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child  
on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of  
to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed  
a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l  jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life  
price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him    
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break  
price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child  
dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is  
writer/director m  night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense  
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 
for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  
does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 
the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either  
as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  
it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  
for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before  
the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving "

1,"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent  
people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee  
the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves  
the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta  
shanta has a small circle of male admirers  
two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim  
the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das  
 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water  ) 
in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears  
one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along  
he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism  
the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses  
it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter  
the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together  
but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state  
a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees  
another man is murdered  
the group of friends will not meet again  
the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles  
it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully "

and most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has "" protection ? "" 
she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times  
the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style  
although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark  
yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn't choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident  
this delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction  
during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story  
first , he's an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father  
next , he's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte  
when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later  
william is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins  
william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s  keller )  
kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy  
nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary  
the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful  
his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids  
rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time "

journalism students should dream of making connections like these  
cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix  
the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other  
what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand  
one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer  
weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron

1,"if you've ever perused my college comedy diary "" another year in the life of a nerd "" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well  
in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him  
so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room  
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk  
scratch that idea  
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal  
of course , in my case it would be a silent picture  
even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? )  
i'm glad i did  
peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie  
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries  
falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you "" columbo "" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off  
falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die

after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave  
the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( "" communists ! "" )  
the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her  
so , in his grandson's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed   "
1,"martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life  
it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker  
this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest  
newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful  
the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others  
on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life  
archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen  
archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world  
archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status  
the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not  
it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions  
there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for  
in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun  
the performances are absolutely breathtaking  
day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take  
pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well  
ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending  
the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory  
scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking  
his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight "

comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew  
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good  ""

let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  let's move to the movie itself  
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew

| now with search engine * * * 
a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel "" arkham asylum "" , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a "" valentine "" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch  
believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l  jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore )  
his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder  
every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so "" high concept "" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's "" caveman "" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn  
with a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with "" gotham pd  "" 
that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  
the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  
it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park  in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself  
whether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far  
it , along with m  night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal "" the dark knight returns "" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics  
readers of sam keith's brilliant "" the maxx "" comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne  
the failure of both "" the maxx "" tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy  
luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film  
kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering  
_the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape "
1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure "

the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days  
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name  
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience  
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up  
since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity "
1," "" you leave little notes on my pillow  
i told you a million times i can't stand little notes on my pillow  
'we are all out of corn flakes - f  u  ' 
it took me three hours to figure out that 'f  u  ' was felix unger  "" 
--- a frustrated oscar madison ( walter matthau ) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger ( jack lemmon ) , in the odd couple  
the classic neil simon comedy ( based on his own stage play ) about suicidal felix ( lemmon ) , who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar ( matthau ) to stay with him in his apartment after felix's wife throws him out and files for divorce  
the hook : oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way , while felix is an obsessive/compulsive neat freak  
the two men , despite their friendship , instantly clash  
movies just aren't as delightfully funny as this one is  
every line of neil simon's dialogue flows like comedic poetry , and all the actors are just perfect in their performances  
lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix , but it's matthau who shines brightest as oscar , whose world is being invaded and rearranged , mostly against his wishes ( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with )  
and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti ? 
the best thing about the film ( and this is a testament to the quality of the writing ) is that it's a comedy with substance  
these two men , even while at each other's throats , genuinely care for one another as friends  
when they clash , it isn't cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist  
movies nowadays , take grumpy old men for example , just don't have that extra spark there  
these days it's just animosity for the sake of comedy  
a television series followed ( starring jack klugman and tony randall ) , which i'll admit i've never seen an episode of in its entirety , and neil simon even scripted the sequel , the odd couple ii , which was released in 1998 "
1,"every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections  
such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life  
despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film  
you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick  
will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m  i  t  , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it  
he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer  
he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk  
after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor  
after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems  
in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love  
the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film  
even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character  
alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it  
the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character  
is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? 
of course  
is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? 
usually , yes  
but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? 
not very likely "
1,"when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called "" the postman , "" i thought , "" an american version of 'il postino ? ' 
starring costner ? 
god help us ! "" 
when i found out that it was not a remake of "" postino "" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , "" 'landworld ? ' 
please , god , make him stop ! "" 
as it turns out , "" the postman "" is a much better film than i had expected  
despite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back  
the setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages  
the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it  
costner's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king  
our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman  
taking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of "" the restored united states  "" 
he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets  
one young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service  
ford spreads the postman's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule  
as war breaks out between bethlehem's army and the postal workers , costner's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution  
his lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy  
 "" postman "" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of "" sergio leone meets frank capra "" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling  
what could have been another knock-off of "" the road warrior "" ( like "" waterworld "" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble  
tate is the stand-out in the movie's large cast  
ford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate's character in his debut film , "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog's cynicism and brutality  
his performance sells the movie  
interestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain  
olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman's love interest , abby  
when they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile "
1,"in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? "" 
obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? 
no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more  
much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie  
it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads )  
but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused  
better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag  
zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs  
fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed  
enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight  
on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme  
much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today  
wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel  
ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr  evil upstages everyone in austin powers  
jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein  
even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse  
as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners  
unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here  
maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years  
she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role  
while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days "
1,"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups  
for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films )  
for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids  
all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing  
but first the basics  
based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using  
shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace  
petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides  
he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle  
as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few  
an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain  
lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way  
all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife  
the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" ) 
farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds  
shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend  
they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet  
for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well  
the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey  
that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate  "" 
but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney "
1,""" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes  
while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it  
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses  
1984  wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again  
bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory  
bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view  
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion  
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii  
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things  
bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship  
dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future  
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax  
singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system  
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals  
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway  
thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system  
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training  
mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work  
he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do "

i almost missed it  
every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like "" summer catch "" and "" bubble boy "" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run

1,"on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred  
on that fateful night , the titanic sunk  
now , more than 50 years later , a film has been made  
and what a film that is  
james cameron's newest movie is a landmark in storytelling , emotion , and special effects  
it starts in the present , where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship's wreckage  
exploring an old chest , paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman  
the drawing is televised and the woman ( gloria stuart ) whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely , the ship's story is told  
leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson , a young man with a sketch book , a heart of gold , an intelligent mind , and not much else  he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game , and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett )  
she grows to love jack , but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance' , cal hockley ( billy zane )  
the film takes its time , and by doing so , makes us care about its characters , and shows us the full aspects of human emotion  
the leads shine ; there is no bad performance ; in fact , these do not seems like performances at all , but genuine people , trapped on the doomed vessel , facing certain death  
watching this film , i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel : the time rose and jack spend together at a third-class-party ; the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude ; the terror felt by all onboard , as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes  
this , the most expensive movie ever made , $200 million , is destined to make its profit back , and then some  
it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year   even this decade  
it is also yet another first : the first $200 million dollar romance , and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed , money extremely  "
1,"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables  
i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel  
i haven't even seen that  
going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical )  
walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material  
writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film  
liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence  
he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior  
the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself  
nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago  
conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo  
valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict  
javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice  
along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes )  
les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture  
the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular  
basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times )  
many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening  
augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow  
he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately "

this is the life of a gladiator  
you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that  
with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire  
and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script  
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited

1,"being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently  
after all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago  
so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it  
i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration  
but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound  
after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen  
based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t  e  
lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever  
bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army  
lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i  
shot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic  
it is absolutely breathtaking  
using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes  
every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land  
david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today  
after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , "" i've got to do a remake of this film ! "" 
but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : "" okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert  
we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice  
and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story  ""

1,"elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s  
it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings  
internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants  
meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power  
little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival  
the film charts elizabeth's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom  
as a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen  
but her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne  
mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land  
once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad  
slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom  
elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers  
her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance )  
also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser  
with few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises  
blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth  
she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma  
though not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk  
she is at home with her character's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes )  
whether fending off unctuous suitors or "" playing "" the houses in court , blanchett's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike "
1,"another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun  
favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women  
the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives  
and all of this is great fun  
swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment  
no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors  
the script , by favreau , is great  
mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex  
the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script  
vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl  
some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature  
vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner  
the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach  ) 
there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence  
embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience  ) 
mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them  
although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends  
they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background  
but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts  
it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles "

murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance  
which brings us to "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame  
the plot of "" nosferatu    "" 
is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's "" dracula ""  
the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania  
he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love  
in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding  
arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin  
the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below  
trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie  
this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted  
additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire "

1,"the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor  
as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money  
in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry  
he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door  
playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie  
this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner  
maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil  
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars  
martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother  
the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain  
in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie  
the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it  
but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger  
he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him  
he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage  
will bowfinger be able to make his film ? 
or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? 
bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line  
the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department  
this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this  
besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch  
if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it "
1,"if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you  
this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat  
and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness  
the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n  m  
inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million  
the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money  
what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( "" i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! "" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel  
the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr  ) ; italian tourist mr  pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer )  
various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city  
screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another  
the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is  
the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs  
without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans  
rat race's cast is first rate  
cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man "" born without a personality  "" 
the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy  
along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! 
and ruthless people "

1,"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc  but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it  
the film's main character , dr  fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category  
one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive  
fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians  
with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate  
this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea  
however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned  
as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other  
when dr  fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn't  "" 
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power  
dr  fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss "
1,"time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe  
this map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time  
the supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map   
during the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen  
but , according to randall , they are just "" borrowing "" it  
kevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling  
he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies  
their first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding  
from here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself  
eventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery  
kevin accidentally saved the king's life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son  
but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic  
meanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him  
when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains "" the most fabulous object in the world "" , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there  
once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive  
time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone  
with a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone  
terry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly  
and finally , if you liked labyrinth , you'll love time bandits "
1,"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind  
i don't know why , really  
haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen  
so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
maybe that's going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy  
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok , maybe that's not enough parallels  
so titanic's not in gwtw's league "
1,"steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker , "" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 )  
much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino  "" 
now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood  
martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned  
his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops  
bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star  
ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously  
he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc  , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance  
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time  
ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities  
 ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l  ron hubbard , founder of scientology  ) 
when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in  
murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage  
always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself  
furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists  
pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly  
murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing  "" 
not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention "
1,"jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance  
for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  
daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes  
the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine )  
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  
however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society  
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller )  
arlo is not happy with his job  
he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer  
and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her  
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  
gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys  
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  
now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  
to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  
however , this is when he is vulnerable    and 
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme "

1," "" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn  "" 
starring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen 
it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone  
it is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward  
he loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays  
within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced  
a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation  
lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm  
she notes that they haven't finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet  
he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves  
it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness  
this sets the tone for the rest of the movie  
there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity  
there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters  
lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion  
they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy  
their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances  
the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment  
there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love  
their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel  
it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes "
1,"every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise  
i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence  
usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo  
it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly  
that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing  
what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history  
princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside  
apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs  worrall ( wendy hughes )  
her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo  
this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr  worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs  worrall  
however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo  
as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner  
it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing  
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr  worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude  
he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs  worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort "

1,"seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p  m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
 "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see  
it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling  
and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story  
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played  
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting  
mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer  
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally )  
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together  
he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him  
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite  
immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel  
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act  
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit  
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present "
1,"eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only  
coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released  
you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox  
let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market  
they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place  
believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p  m  , i saw the little mermaid for the first time  
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom's friends for a couple weeks  
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times  
by the time i got back home , i promised myself i'd never see the movie  
but promises are made to be broken , especially when you're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement  
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games  
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song  
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times  
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells    
the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase  
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans "
1,"gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world 
the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 
when the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow  
with the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems  
this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy  
it's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain  
now it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_  
a perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries  
best of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best  
so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid  
the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists  
coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora )  
mulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal  
 ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met  ) 
the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away  
crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers  
being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller "" the day of the jackal "" , comparison between the two films is inevitable  
there is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure  
as a mystery , "" the jackal "" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had  
holes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up  
for a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot  
the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them "
1,"dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london  
to boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story  
movies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it  
alex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly  
at times it moves beyond film into artwork  
it is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ?  
these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning  
they are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight  
during this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience )  
without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him  
i don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him  
it ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography  
murdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight  
shadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine  
we see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song  
a great entrance  
however , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied  
the city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching  
blade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience  
it is discussed it and argued , therefore a success "
1,"seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p  m  at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 
modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras  
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative  
but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  
labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll  
for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  
we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc  ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc  is relatively unknown  
the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater  
no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  
we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest  
the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives "
1,"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies  
the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting'

if they survive the night they get the money

having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake

geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  
somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  
eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr  blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways  
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night  
if they can they get the money , if not well they don't

but it gets worse  
if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence  
  
  
hell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i'm bound to be lynched  
well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception  
right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ? 
you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about  
after all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? 
well , there's more  
  
  
i actually got choked up , and more than once  
yes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes  
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself  
the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so  
but when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him  
in the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character  
julia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the "" miami vice "" loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn't seem all that interested  
as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women "
1,"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made  
a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget  
in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives  
the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together  
michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group  
after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works  
three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married  
after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times  
this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war  
the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act  
the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future  
the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong  
the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river  
this prison , run by the v  c  , 
initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other  
steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate  
michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun  
personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes  
the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated "
1,"how many of us would become strippers ? 
for those of us who wouldn't , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? 
that's probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons  
as you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions  
would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? 
in case you haven't guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain't  
it's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication  
it is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need  
what to do ? 
it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis  
it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash  
eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance  
these include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant  
when the sextet is complete , we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy  
we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place  
as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising "" the full monty "" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all  
  
  
and i mean * all *  
the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add  
it's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater  
with the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way  
the amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film  
there's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn't be better "
1," "" last night "" could have an "" aka "" tagged on the end of it that says , "" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine ""  
 "" last night "" is about just that  
the last night of planet earth's existence  
the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000  
how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained  
nor is the event itself  
throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening  
in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre  
he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life  
the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters  
mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material  
the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence  
there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband  
her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end  
finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of  
mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months  
these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh  
we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours  
rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies  
he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants "

1,"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance  
for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers  
lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer  
but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal  
in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered  
`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways  
in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack  
`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go  
tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout  
with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year  
even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period  
as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma  
her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star  
meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life  
both actors perform beyond the call of duty  
the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected  
the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time  
additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance  
`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast  
this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching "

1," "" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material  
the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas  
the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz )  
the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern )  
after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed  
as robert puts it : "" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her  "" 
after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well  
 "" okay , there is only one option now  
you can forget about calling the police , "" he says  
by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell  
 "" very bad things , "" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , "" there's something about mary , "" wanted to be  
it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end  
the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous  
during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed  
the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable  
there's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts  
cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends  
diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january  
by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , "" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , "" i couldn't help but crack up at how "" balls-to-the-wall "" this film had become  
jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with "

robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando )  
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime  
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens  
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment  
there is no rock score  
there are no ballet- like martial arts  
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script  
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks  
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out  
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe

1,"that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into "" the wedding singer , "" the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus  
does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? 
or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? 
or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? 
well , there's a little bit of all of that in "" the wedding singer "" and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr  sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time  
that's because , in a nutshell , "" the wedding singer "" is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across  
that's right  
sweet  
the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ? 
well , it's just lovely  
i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence  
instead ? 
well , i've said it before  
sweet  
the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for  
when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy )  
it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love  
aww    
sandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film  
writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion  
it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans  
herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s "

instead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations  
you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it  
the romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter "
1,"jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u  s  s

gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation  
as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again  
this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f  murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will  
it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists  
of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists  
insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films  
the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group  
in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction  
it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line  
many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat  
the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense  
there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? 
the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f  murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen  
so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible  
but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever "
1,"anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases    
 ( especially hercules )    
emotion  
all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together  
not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works  
the story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film  
anastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury )  
but anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins  
the grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution  
a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money  
they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia  
dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov  
the plot is actually quite well structured  
there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored  
what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either  
there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses "
1,"pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing  
it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience  
don't be fooled  
pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest  
it starts off with blistering intensity  
a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns  
among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely  
there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film  
there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal  
and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns  
the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other  
confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment  
those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh  
fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface  
unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters  
the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory  
or does it ? 
pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up  
just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false  
the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth  
a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations "
1,"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war  
broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  
shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society  
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory  
as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces  
like private eriksson ( michael j  fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces  
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  
soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  
he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  
his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power  
in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  
it makes your blood boil  
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well "
1,"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 
mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus  
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime  
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime  
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness  
sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life  
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  
the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization  
however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead    
shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30%  
this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors  "
1,"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies  
on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron  
then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott  
however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier )  
after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield  
the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges  
at first , briggs doesn't want to be there  
he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone  
however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature  
the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift  
briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers  
after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished  
and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds  
greenfingers , which is "" inspired by actual events , "" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that  
despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show  
one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent  
of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not "" prison love "" )  
to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace  
i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers  
the movie deals with people and scores on that concept "
1,"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8  50  
[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail "
1,"let's say you live at the end of an airport runway  
large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace  
let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home  
now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth  
wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? 
of course you would  
but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? 
that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale  
unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice  
not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back  
the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest  
in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful  
the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets  
it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film  
i just sat back and enjoyed myself  
the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever  
what makes this film different is its characters  
darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard  
steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers  
the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying  
they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing  
we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection "
1,"the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season  
bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep  
for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive  
after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled  
immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow  
that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail  
thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette  
years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert  
valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own  
the "" father "" and "" daughter "" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson )  
the decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow  
he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace  
production designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast  
neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role  
the younger members of the cast fare less well  
danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard  
as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved  
while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved  
not even reaching the "" touching "" level is the cosette-marius pairing  
my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) "
1,"at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember  
the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? 
not in your dreams ! 
imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you  
believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter  
the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious  
majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert  
as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army )  
they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces  
frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals  
as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it  
`special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie  
three kings is much smarter than that  
as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray  
i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity  
this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant  
action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence  
they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts  
not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood )  
great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director  
three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least  
highly recommended "
1,"who would have thought ? 
jim carrey does drama  
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" 
however , it was an even better premise for a drama  
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  
that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey )  
truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way  
christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world  
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  
there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal  
the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world  
we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past  
it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  
the film can be described in one word : weird  
it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did  
it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it  
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  
the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama  
no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey  
and he showed them all up  
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  
i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination "
1,
1,"when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences  
the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions  
the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life  
decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids  
yes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills  
but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation  
the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon  
made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience  
it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor  
lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert  
he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk  
interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene  
lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago  
the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts  
the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later )  
the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys  
on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive  
in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy  
the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence  
although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief "
1,"in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  
i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  
but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception  
if you haven't yet seen it , go see it  
now  
stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you've seen it , come back

american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream

1,"magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft  
at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film  
it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions  
it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking  
it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers  
director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax  
the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives  
there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants  
there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son  
there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public  
and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process  
given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h  macy )  
a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman )  
hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair  
it is not a pleasant movie  
there is not one bad note in the acting  
it is affecting and layered and wonderful  
there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films "
1," "" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred ""  
a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off  
but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film  
what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative  
screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions  
no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer  
fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis ""  
the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches  
jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance  
arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state  
what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho  
it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own  
though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school  
we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well  
several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is    well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive  
the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about  
fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film "
1,"in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title  
one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey  
quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat  
the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such  
without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character  
following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  
i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is  
if there were ever a clear case for "" less is more , "" this would be it  
the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene  
by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily  
in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis  
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator  
or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image  
william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , "" well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it  "" 
great stuff  
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible  
we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him  
there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between  
this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down  
he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance "
1,"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america  
o  j  
simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers  
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms  
and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood  
whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks  
so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat  
however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one  
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it  
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever  
but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting  
a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998  
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations  
his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid  
if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average  
luckily , he has a strong supporting cast  
william h  macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood  
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor "
1,"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens  
however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill  
in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture  
the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps  
peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation  
every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before    in 
other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life  
he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities  
he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself  
everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck  
but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions  
he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing  
he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like  
peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman )    no ,

1,"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one  
the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner  
anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration  
the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one  
bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so  
a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye  
after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr  ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie  
but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project  
kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film  
after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge  
the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage  
the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him  
when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes  
these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse  
bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen  
certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny  
no , hilarious  
standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels )  
and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas "
1," "" six days , seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare  
here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff  
of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be  
as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance  
the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by  
the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe  
robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there  
the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization  
a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other  
meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors )  
that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin  
and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience  
director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk  
at a slim 101 minutes , "" six days , seven nights "" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title  
michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is "" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? "" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging  
even the movie's more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink  
heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days , seven nights "" ' heterosexual pairing  
 ( so she's a lesbian

1,"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last  
george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy  
return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films  
the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone  
instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears  
even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around  
with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman  
return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back  
luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine  
their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt  
it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play  
from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch  
as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor  
so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks  
there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader  
return of the jedi has some interesting elements  
the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted  
from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films  
not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved  
on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects "

1,"notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica  
the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers  
if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards  
starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan 
exotica is a film that grows on retrospection  
exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film  
all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account  
the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction  
exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique  
at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features  
the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films  
similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots  
on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at  
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life  
exotica is very much worth seeing  
it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december )  
in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release  
apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie  
the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen  
but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica

1,"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different  
its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books  
the parallels don't end there , either  
atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher  
even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile  
in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile  
king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter )  
it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son  
bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich  
when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror  
ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers  
i won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile )  
atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years  
atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red  
the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr  lecter  
most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider  
while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency  
goldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter )  
it's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o "
1,"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create  
christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues  
it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  
as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  
as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  
i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  
the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel  
for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  
both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  
the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  
as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining  
lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference  
screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  
some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  
thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut  
side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  
the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian  
it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous "

in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish  
she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint  
a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness

after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo  
the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere  
the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience  
besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle "
1,"review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag  
but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects  
and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily  
the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get  
michael j  fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts  
he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them  
this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago  
frank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson  
when dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox  
but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead  
this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost  
things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town  
fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that  
so when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer  
fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit  
there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh  
the movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film  
the mix between these genres are perfect  
no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa "
1," "" the end of the affair "" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs  
although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience  
based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters  
there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore )  
sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy  
it's all work and no play with him  
while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her  
unfortunately the two break up  
this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present  
it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too  
while this may sound straight forward it's not  
it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love  
all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest  
with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why  
the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan  
even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive  
what's so moving about it you ask ? 
the tragedy of it all  
it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing  
it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect  
everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces "
1,"john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel  
you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  
it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive  
in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  
about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda  
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie  
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings  
dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl  
feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model  
now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases  
species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist  
forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script  
the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years  
 ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings  
even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet  ) 
the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt  
the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms  
the first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos  
she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be "
1,"wong kar-wei's "" fallen angels "" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while  
unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for  
ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of "" fallen angels "" , this is not so  
every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at  
wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal "" knock off "" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe  
ugh  ) 
the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives  
i can't say much more than that as i didn't really know what was going on most of the time  
in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character  
the constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character  
we're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters  
 "" fallen angels "" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level  
in fact , i'd go so far as to say that "" fallen angels "" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i've ever seen  
sure , there's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating  
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images  
there were far too many instances during "" fallen angels "" in which i asked myself , "" now who are these people again ? 
is this that first couple or the second couple ? "" 
it was impossible to keep track  
perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with "" name cards "" , as in scorsese's "" mean streets ""  
that's really besides the point , though  
wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that's he's a movie-maker to watch  
let's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies "
1,"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king  
the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia  
at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry  
in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different  
there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged  
dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed  
the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively  
although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner  
unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition  
in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product  
the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date  
the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with  
the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot  
namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d  
dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney  
the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent  
for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense  
the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way  
in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything  
moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family "
1," "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes  
while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it  
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses  
1984  wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again  
bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory  
bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view  
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion  
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii  
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things  
bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship  
dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future  
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax  
singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system  
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals  
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway  
thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system  
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training  
mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work  
he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do "
1,"when 17 year old beau hall ( jonathan tucker , "" the virgin suicides "" ) gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion , club owner darby reese ( josh lucas , "" session 9 "" ) , his mom , margaret ( tilda swinton , "" the war zone "" ) pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone  
instead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese  
the next morning margaret discovers darby's dead body on their beach and , suspecting the worst , weights it down in a distant part of the lake  
but her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , "" practical magic "" ) in "" the deep end  "" 
the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , "" the game "" )  
she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated  
gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic  
it's a terrific performance  
the stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding's 40's noir novel 'the blank wall' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic  
alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese's body has been discovered  
he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he'll turn the tape over to the reno police  
subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail  
there's yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , "" dead man walking "" ) is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of the money is delivered  
visnjic's dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment  
his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret's inherent decency and her workaday surroundings  
also outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother  
initially beau's the typical sullen teen  
'you're blowing this out of proportion , ' he says of her concerns about reese , not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship  
as his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn't commit , beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion , turning tables  
his early black eye becomes her later split lip "
1,"aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads  
the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again  
when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson  
waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang  
as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence  
randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance  
the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within  
i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation  
kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one  
if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d  w  
griffith ( thematically speaking )  
there is not a single likable character in the film  
the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles )  
the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost  
even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects  
the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge  
what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society  
the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable  
damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful "
1,"razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998  
official release : halloween 
reviewed by vince yim 
`you think you know all about vampires    believe 
me    you 
know f * ck all  ' 
with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly )  
made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being  
so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? 
with that out of the way , let me say this  
this film is bad  
this film is really , really bad  
yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable  
with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade  
still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film  
agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever  
period  
razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film  
the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) "
1," "" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics  
and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it  
the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow )  
he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do  
as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama  
there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate  
so why did i enjoy it so much ? 
for one thing , the cast is great  
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role  
we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort  
yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be  
and he never broods  
the rest of the cast is equally impressive  
john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian  
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter  
by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character  
another nice touch is the music  
we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all  
the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun  
during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing  
of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic "

of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too  
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero  
in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers  
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation  
a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently  
the casting is what puts this film over the top  
the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully  
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark

1," "" he's back , and it's about time  "" 
was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know )  
the motto was well chosen  
the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts  
as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who  
is it the acting ? 
hell , no ! 
paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene )  
he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would  
daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr  grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well  
young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent  
the only problem with the acting is eric roberts  
one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion  "" 
but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always    
dress    
for the occasion  "" 
you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor "

1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing

1,"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece  
certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's  
the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war  
 "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history  
the plot is fairly simple  
captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty  
his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice ""  
along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt  col  kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies  
willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives  
willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending  
the movie is visually breathtaking  
the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate  
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening  
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie  
the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character  
the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt  col  who cares more about the surf than about the mission "
1,"it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of "" the horse whisperer , "" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to "" projection difficulties  "" 
robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with "" titanic , "" but is only now making its much anticipated debut  
this ( strategic ? ) 
delay has allowed "" the horse whisperer "" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office  
no matter  
redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments  
whatever the reasons for its postponement , "" the horse whisperer "" supports the old adage "" better late than never  "" 
redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment  
while parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast  
when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim  
refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too  
undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal  
redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds  
the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints  
redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role  
dianne wiest , chris cooper ( "" lone star "" ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast  
and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence  
one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing  
redford's canvas is huge and exquisite  
he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder  
veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since "" the horse whisperer "" is "" dances with wolves "" by way of "" out of africa "" ( oscar winners both for barry ) "

1,"reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind  
if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way  
with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation  
it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down  
her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please  
to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills  
eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way  
yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf  
he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him  
however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell  
 "" dear god , "" he prays  
 "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life  "" 
guess who then shows up ? 
she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse  
 "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul  "" 
there's even an escape clause  
if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over  
the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love  
but when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details  
for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else  
apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul "
1,"i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival  
'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read  
intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years  
even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated  
only now do i see the error of my ways  
after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a "" holocaust comedy "" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps  
rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation  
roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse )  
through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this "" beautiful princess "" , as he calls her  
employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini )  
life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice  
granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a "" hogan's heros "" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews  
somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject  
so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a "" holocaust comedy ""  
but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me  
the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a "" triumph of the human spirit "" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway  
some have called the story an "" affirmation of the beauty of life "" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy  
the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting  
essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film  
however , i am not denying the movie's greatness "
1,"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen  
this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone  
i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again  
i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s  
in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! 
if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying  
the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives  
in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that  
so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old  
plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator  
his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date  
a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency  
the two do not like each other  
one night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control  
soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer  
critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline  
on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy  
the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man  
but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick  
i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool )  
of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude "
1,"meet joe black ( reviewed on nov  27/98 ) 
starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani 
in "" meet joe black "" , brad pitt plays death  
that's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description  
death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human  
death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues  
for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani  
obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? 
besides eternal damnation , of course  
there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company  
 "" meet joe black "" runs just under three hours  
i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics  
 "" meet joe black "" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be  
every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long  
and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should  
a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is  
pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death  
i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him  
i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was  
that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting  
hopkins gives his usual excellent performance  
he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner "
1," "" well this is not mission : difficult , mr  hunt , it's mission : impossible  
difficult should be a walk in the park for you  "" 
---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch  
a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection  
a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause )  
posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do  
the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods  
ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's  
reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team  
ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah  
although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy )  
that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo  
the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while  
unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series  
ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! )  
john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups  
the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film  
thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed  
robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus "
1,"the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is  
i mean that as the highest compliment  
if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide  
the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence  
along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable  
the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby  
they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair  
complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete  
in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved  
john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong  
claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her  
andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence  
cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train  
it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed  
a pall is cast on the whole affair  
a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments  
in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love  
we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship  
during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could  
all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates "

1,"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america  
this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war  
however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp  
these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning  
as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start  
the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved  
from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r  lee ermey  
apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations  
private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt  
hartman  
the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on  
the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt  
hartman , continues on  
private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor  
he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop  
that is , until sgt  
hartman comes up with a new plan  
he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can  
pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst "
1,"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film  
sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride  
i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes  
surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say  
but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i  i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year  
time alone will make that call  
but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side  
we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win  
that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last  
the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot  
unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics  
carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town  
truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers  
there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good  
but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky  
this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program  
what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir  
the soundstage , we're told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space  "" 
truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams "
1,"slavery is bad  
after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out  
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film  
during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery  
fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners  
freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt  
after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think  
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states  
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy  
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property  
if they are property , who do they belong to ? 
their masters ? 
the spanish government ? 
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 
the us government ? 
the defendants are pawns in several games  
abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause  
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees  
south carolina senator john c  calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states  
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends  
when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes  
even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims  
at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners  
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court "
1,"this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex  
>from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon  
 ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year  ) 
the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive  
a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously  
this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination  
in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime  
however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless  
seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts  
a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate  
the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive  
as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around  
not a good sign    
to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago  
it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it  
something very , very evil   "
1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary gray's the negotiator  
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l  jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office  
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but    "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did  
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j  t  
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed  
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue "
1,"the film "" magnolia "" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests  
the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower  
they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart  
the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially  
from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain  
they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness  
whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one  
 "" magnolia "" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of "" boogie nights "" fame  
the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make "" magnolia "" memorable  
however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing  
anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful  
he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long  
any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending  
from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring  
it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot  
this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation  
every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees  
for example , cop john c  reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly  
the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer "

the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months  
 "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader  
a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention  
the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine ""  
he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country  
he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950  
the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results  
eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india  
comparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable  
both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt  
 "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story  
in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser  
the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons )  
the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character  
on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts  
some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here  
glossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack  
the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins  
his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail "
1,"with stars like sigourney weaver ( "" alien "" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc  ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot  
sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller  
helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr  ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak  
incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes  
a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco  
detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first  
copycat "" borrows "" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work  
but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also    
much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama  
even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments    
weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona )  
harry connick jr  , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter  
which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please "
1,"i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer  
even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen  
but i don't care  
not even a little  
my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great  
2 ) drew barrymore is great  
3 ) the movie is so funny  
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard  
i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers  
sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music  
in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness  
a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone )  
with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress  
she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months  
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans  
soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other  
oh sure , it's trite  
and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience  
what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances  
barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) "
1,"a miracle of filmmaking , "" some like it hot "" is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists  
it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make  
jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves  
one night , as they're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided  
as it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e  stone )  
several weeks later , on valentine's day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage  
eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid  
the only catch   its a girls band  
so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida  
on the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love  
jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there's two problems : 1 ) they're in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e  brown ) falls madly in love with daphne  
what follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the "" italian opera lovers festival ""  
tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar  
marilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity  
the scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon  
lemmon is hysterical as daphne "
1,"film adaptation of hunter s  thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title  
director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7  5/10 ) ) 
 "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam  
plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr  gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race  
during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls  
the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use  
critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess  
if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels  
if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5  5/10 for all those sober dogs )  
note : i have not read thompson's book  
having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level  
this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot  
it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s  thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine  
it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states  
johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop  
during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole "

1,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
we're the fans , not the freaks  
we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down  
all right , stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately , it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good  
anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) "
1,"for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america's finest actresses  
in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well  
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina  
through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident  
that's just the beginning of her troubles  
bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come  
anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident  
anney's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill  
glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( "" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? 
i'll tell you when - never ! "" 
he's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper  
when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour  
things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment  
while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other  
the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance  
her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well  
leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage  
one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away  
of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance  
there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance  
still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power  
huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone "
1,"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being  
even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience  
on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view  
this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life  
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense  
instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters  
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime  
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much  
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible  
distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect  
in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it  
after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film  
fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film  
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images  
characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions  
every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions  
because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life  
even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy  
when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour  
unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics "
1,"you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character  
such is the case with "" the big lebowski , "" joel and ethan coen's first venture since their "" fargo "" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods  
there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because "" lebowski "" is an effort that makes words like "" strange "" and "" unusual "" seem like an understatement  
thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success  
the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? )  
one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude  
once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long  
soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help  
it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn  
the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself  
chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore )  
 "" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative  
the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does  
the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick  
whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively  
there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring  
the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given  
bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie  
goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot  
john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction "
1,"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes  "
1,"close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness  
a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols  
an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' "" a clockwork orange  "" 
a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of "" delicatessen , "" or "" the tin drum  "" 
imagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from "" the butcher boy  "" 
imagine that and more  
neil jordan's latest film "" stars "" rea in more ways than one  
rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's "" the crying game , "" contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s  
but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's "" performance "" worth watching , worth listening to  
and that's only half the fun  
playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation  
for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of "" the butcher boy , "" owens commands virtually every frame  
it's impossible to take your eyes off him  
with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs  nugent ( fiona shaw )  
in fact , everything was ok until "" the nugent "" came to town  
now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( "" the butcher boy "" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many )  
 "" pigs ! "" screams mrs  nugent at the brady menagerie  
 "" you're all pigs ! ""

1,"denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances  
this perhaps may be washington's very best to date  
he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly  
his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is  
when his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices  
the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago  
the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history  
he is that amazing  
the problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles  
mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors  
this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars  
denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance  
as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system  
>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit  
then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder  
carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed  
from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america  
after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison  
it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place  
the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released "

1,"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory  
this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this  
not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie  
the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city  
gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  
gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better  
the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  
try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups  
if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher  
in many ways , i was surprised by this movie  
to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was  
don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie  
secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance  
he provided a fantastic performance  
the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense  
gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film  
for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable  
and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is  
writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions  
mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film "
1,"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well  
during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals  
a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one  
  
  
scream 2 ! 
1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! 
a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment  
in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! 
sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater  
meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture  
as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria  
this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what's been done  
  
  
and finish what hasn't ! 
of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies  
this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied  
as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain  
i will note , however , that the "" whodunit ? "" 
did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie  
all the actors outdo themselves here  
we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing  
the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years  
we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place "

1,"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers  
the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters  
everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers  
although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride  
liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good  
the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good  
there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk  
the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life  
holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature  
askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious  
no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying  
he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it  
the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining  
also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance  
the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes  
it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better  
the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another  
also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky  
still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it  
it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag "

1,"you've got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh , the video came out ? 
got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
buy a disney t-shirt ! 
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  
soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense  
when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points "
1,"the question isn't why has grease been reissued  
the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  
no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? 
the answer is not an easy one  
grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era  
the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited  
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening  
but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground  
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider  
what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history  
ok , let's not be a spoilsport  
grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers  
it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career  
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly  
cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur  
between grease and 1996's evita  , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand  
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded  
today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen  
today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed  
secondly , a lack of talent "
1,"what is freedom ? 
how does one determine who is free ? 
in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now  
yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations  
that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama "" amistad "" is about  
through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad ""  
on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew  
however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder  
in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away  
the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back  
the two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves  
the american ship that found the slaves also wants them  
in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free  
they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them  
through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins )  
the film itself is a visual wonder  
spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well  
at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical  
however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag  
the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified  
the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist  
but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning "
1,"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently  
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is  
aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery  
while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun  
the story begins in hollywood in 1947  
cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r  k  
maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work  
maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots  
valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon  
upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect  
the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name  
along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon  ' 
`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in )  
director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators  
also bob hoskins' performance should be credited  
he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars  
according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off  
`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film  
one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) "

1,"all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch  
and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season  
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  
the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film  
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  
american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park  
it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny  
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night  
jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead  
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie    '  
of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner  
there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  
american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it  
i loved the young cast in this movie  
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances "
1,"lisa cholodenko's "" high art , "" is an intelligent , quiet drama  
its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters  
they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged  
judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of  
syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , "" frame  "" 
she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things  
one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness  
syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before  
lucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the "" frame "" editors to do a piece on her work  
all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons  
 "" high art , "" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd's luck begins to rise  
the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality  
as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed  
with this picture , ally sheedy's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career  
her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her , is heartbreaking  
although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role  
also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , "" love and other catastrophes , "" wh caught me by surprise with her performance  
easily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently  
as accurate as almost every detail is in , "" high art , "" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role  
by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other "
1,"richard linklater's "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas  
most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning  
their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such  
ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out  "" 
linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door  
  
  
  
it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are  
the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film  
other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo  "" 
for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types  
near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars  
another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera  
and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below  
the only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end  
since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while  
there are only so many times you can hear , "" hey , what's going on ? "" 
 "" not much , what are you up to ? "" 
 "" nothing really , just hanging around , "" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization  
and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique  
instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too "
1,"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly  
since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames  
consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes  
it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn  
carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama  
carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance  
in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality  
he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas  
among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman )  
carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace  
old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake  
carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film  
in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station  
both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely  
yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling  
carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit  
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion  
you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble  
indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind  "" 
pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy "
1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )  
what the hell has happened to him ? 
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  
 "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  
 "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  
 "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film  
even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  
if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him  
 "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  
instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  
and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis  
woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  
much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation "
1,"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire  ? 
there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness  ? 
bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression  ? 
it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story  
 ? 
beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again  ? 
he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane  
 ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers  
 ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto  
 ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest  ? 
 "" you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ? 
 "" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? "" 
the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman  
 ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated  
 ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences  
beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent  ? 
his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself  ? 
here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure  ? 
i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film )  ? 
some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him  ? 
much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it  ? 
it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre  ? 
what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale "
1,"synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case  
if she can survive the demanding s  e  a  l  
training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps  
throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie  
review : the title of this movie turned me off at first  
i mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? 
the other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned  
i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor  
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie  
moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men  
the storyline is simple  
anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push  
using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s  e  a  l  
training  
jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength "

1,"the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials  
with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal  
deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero  
and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington  
 ( a heist comedy ? 
yup  
deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else  ) 
wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid  
ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless  
 ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session  ) 
and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map  
the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness  
nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking )  
instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire  
it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion  
deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages  
it's all : "" what do i love ? 
what is it that brings me joy ? 
baseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat  
he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way  
it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script  
hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous  
this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up "

i'm beginning to get fed up  
over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films  
the good balances the bad  
i try to see both in equal proportions  
but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie  
it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while  
and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify  
far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie  
it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life  
mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in    
california ? 
    
for safe-keeping  
okay  
a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism  
the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif  
the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all "
1," "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses  
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted  
after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch  
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! 
there is no goddamned blair witch ! ""  
jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage  
after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet  
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt ""  
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers  
the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold  "" 
this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience  
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening  
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain  
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies  
they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth  
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality  
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods   
documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background  
the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue "
1,"call it touched by a demon  
gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist  
if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven  
in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out  
 ( remember bob ? ) 
the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope  
a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice  
now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around  "" 
shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk  
minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead  
but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel  
and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will  
only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against  
the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger  
as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks  
shadows and night scenes abound  
the days are cloudy and unpromising  
this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men  
fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized "
1,"i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night  
i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life  
i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former  
the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty  
he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original  
he's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce  
his loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday  
during the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat  
after a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure  
on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance  
first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert  
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself  
there is some character development during the film  
the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes  
the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict  
the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end  
humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film  
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? )  
however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience  
the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt "

1,"allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of "" out of sight , "" as the maid of a crooked financier  
in keeping with her past performances , allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria's secret ensemble which begs the question , did they really need a costume designer for this ? 
 "" out of sight "" is not likely to secure ms  allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , "" jackie brown , "" but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the "" also starring "" credits given her limited screen time  
the real stars of "" out of sight "" are george clooney ( "" batman & robin "" by way of "" e  r  "" ) and jennifer lopez ( "" selena "" ) , whose winning chemistry , coupled with steven soderbergh's freeze-frame directorial technique , help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard's original work  
with the success of "" get shorty "" three years ago , filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch  
in "" out of sight , "" clooney stars as jack foley , a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery--he just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal , claiming that his "" partner "" ( just another customer it so happens ) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn't comply  
for all of jack's nice-guy charm though , he's not very lucky  
his latest scam lands him in florida's glades correctional facility  
federal marshal karen sisco ( lopez ) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ( ving rhames , typically appealing ) are breaking out  
there's a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car  
it's in these cramped confines , pressed intimately together , that jack and karen start falling for one another  
the mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another's grasp  
karen follows jack to detroit , where he's about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes )  
it's during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance  
clooney's range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm  
lopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional  
she dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar  
especially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub "
1,"the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one  
it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his "" attorney "" dr  gonzo ( benito del toro )  
these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path  
duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won  
he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference  
fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs  
it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark  
director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them  
they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles  
the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand  
all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture  
thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important  
now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it  
materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever  
the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment  
in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements  
yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance  
the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations  
unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo "
1,"until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie  
forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year  
even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen  
luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001  
so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place  
robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash  
his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere  
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs  harper after he's released and ben is hanged  
but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling  
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time  
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? 
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? 
 ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem  ) 
yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter  
powell's "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? )  
and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style  
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact  
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club  
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears

1,"the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 ) 
starring : tim curry and susan sarandon 
cult films are never mainstream  
the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ? '  
fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane  
the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films  
period  
like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it  
this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining  
they go to a castle to try to use the phone  
little do they know that the castle is owned by dr  frank n  furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons  
the acting is pretty good overall  
tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n  furter  
it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors  
even the singer meatloaf is in it ! ! 
the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way  
a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me  
all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing  
barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience  
meatloaf sings like meatloaf "
1,"of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments  
i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes  
and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny  
usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign  
waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event  
the play is being directed by corky st  clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success  
teaming up with st  clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others  
everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out  
these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are  
although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! 
if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it  
some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros  
as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous  
thankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes  
like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! )  
like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach  
you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people ! 
even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary  
and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful ! 
as a word of note , despite it's "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean  
this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words "
1,"some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies  
that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  
such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  
something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c  scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  
one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  
van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home  
however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film  
infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself  
unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless  
things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley )  
almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars  
it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt  
in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience  
for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s  
on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great  
but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons  
the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity  
instead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms  
schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job "

[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] 
existenz has been called "" a gooey matrix "" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off  
the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , "" real "" reality  
a major difference is that "" the matrix "" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true  
and oh what a reality it is  
david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest  
maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre  
technology is organic , but only some of it  
cars are normal  
gas stations are the same  
cell phones are glowing bug like appendages  
you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a "" pod "" )  
high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters  
a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt

sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game

1,"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is  
he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film  
i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people  
i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen  
i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe  
in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film  
it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good  
it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan  
since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! 
i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film  
no words can describe the dvd  
in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963  
now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis  
the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut  
why is he stalking her ? 
check out halloween ii it explains it all  
on this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive  
the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk  
nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did  
what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style  
the movie is flawless if not perfect  
no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will "

1,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  "" 
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things )  
 "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" )  
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it  
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad  
it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one  
after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this  
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side  
this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down  
okay , it is a let-down  
i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good  
but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand  
in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless  
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva  
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light  
for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off  
however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful "
1,"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding  
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986  
but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film  
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life  
written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor  
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare  
as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting  
walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob  
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain  
she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits  
she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown  
and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance  
thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters  
the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family  
ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister  
walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious  
when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values  "" 
ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises  
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body "
1,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  
probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow  
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it  
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george  
clarence has got his own problems , however  
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by  
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life  
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr  potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  
one christmas , potter gets his chance  
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money  
without the money , the bank must close down  
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide  
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george  
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about  
it's a wonderful life does have its faults  
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men "
1,"assume nothing  
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman  
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor  
seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass  
charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes  
the point ? 
to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course  
oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go  
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy  
well , another popular phrase of the 90's is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well  
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind  
why is this ? 
he thinks oscar is gay  
he's not afraid to share this with him either  
oscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth  
the word spreads instantly through town  
will oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? 
one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles

1,"when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space  
it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver  
but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks  
if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? 
-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex  
even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery  
the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody  
all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america  
ironically , powers' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! "" 
has almost become an icon of the late 90s  
thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome  
the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life  
it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones  
austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr  evil ( meyers again ) has stolen  
he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr  evil yet again  
surprisingly , the real star is dr  evil rather than austin  
he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie  
perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately "
1,"set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city  
his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town  
instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead  
therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city  
due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p  knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city  
he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff's murder  
when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong  
in the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall  
with the rumpo's past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! 
sid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground  
jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter  
other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively  
big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past  
joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid  
however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee's performance is rather poor  
kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the 'judge'  
even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite  
a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on  
the death count is the highest of any carry on film  
sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable "
1,"with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications  
and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent  
but margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated  
her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd  
his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau  
 "" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese  
her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse  
there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight  
the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest  
with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard  
but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated  
soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova  
alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day  
but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected  
based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" )  
it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese  
the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel  
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton  
swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year's "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  
the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other  
both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  
however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  
the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p  j  hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  
the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  
for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background  
my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one  
my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  
in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too  
the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality  
throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  
there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments "
1,"i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool  
i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement  
this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm  
then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups  
it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom  "" 
ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business  
then , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her  
as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had  
forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue  
ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation  
sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping  
the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely  
lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification  
the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution  
forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was  
lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense  
earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine  
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom  
that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes  
for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans "
1,"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered  
with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols  
their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness  
less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue  
not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development  
that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level  
the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis  
intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "" human interconnectedness "" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me )  
shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene  
those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself  
adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london  
every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives  
he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years  
she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction  
they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation  
as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines  
in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy  
if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment  
chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train  
the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines "
1,"for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow  
firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship  
secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes  
thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose  
finally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing  
of these four , the last one can be a nightmare  
meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression  
if you're lucky , things will go smoothly  
but , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong  
and with a name like that , how could it not ? 
when greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive  
when he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , "" not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? "" 
it's definitely not a good start  
but greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie  
he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner  
it doesn't matter that he's jewish  
if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do  
 "" oh god    you're 
such a good god "" , he moons  
his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the "" deniro squint "" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin "

kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature , most notably miramax , the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob's distributor  
others deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas  
this is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax's production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers  
jay's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts  
no matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country  
but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow "" the book "" - the rules of the road  
of course jay's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride  
jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie's weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated  
really , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne  
the movie's highlight , though , is near the finale  
in hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season  
here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other's careers and film choices  
and the laughs continue to grow  
next up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson's creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic  
the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles  
finally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature  
this bit will leave you howling "
1,"by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining  
to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement  
the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed  
this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring  
the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  
as mrs  paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  
to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  
stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband  
 "" a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial  
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister  
 "" she's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty  
 "" she's too fine a woman  "" 
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd )  
unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama  
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  
she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradine's portrait nearby "
1,"synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels  
there is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor  
within the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation  
preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth  
manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a "" phantom "" menace  
jedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala's home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best )  
on the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  
the five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place  
can they free amidala's helpless planet ? 
opinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace's greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television  
given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it  
does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? 
director george lucas answers , "" it's only a movie  "" 
to me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound  
visually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children  
it is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera  
at least this much is clear : there's plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it's good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes  
weaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance  
at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme  
this dilutes the central story  
additionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie  
veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads "
1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie "

they also are wanna-be contenders , but neither has had much success  
their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw , leaving bobby's record at 5-5-1  
these two l  a  not-so-wise guys also work for max ( peter falk ) , a mid-level mobster , who is patient and understanding with bobby , but who hates ricky's guts  
max has an easy job for bobby ; fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz ( a smooth and silky sean combs )  
bobby , because of his lifelong friendship with ricky , pleads with max to give his pal another chance and let him tag along to the big apple  
against his better judgment , max agrees  
of course ricky , a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks , nearly screws up everything  
while bobby tries to stay calm and professional , ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano  
the constrast in styles and the chemistry between favreau and vaughn is what makes made so enjoyable to watch  
favreau with his hound-dog face and slow-burn personality could be a modern-day oliver hardy , only much wiser  
vaughn is like someone vaccinated with a phonograph needle , he just keeps yakking and yakking , unaware of the havoc he creates  
yet despite bobby's constant aggravation and agitation with his partner , a bond of affection and loyalty binds them  
the contrast between the two friends is interesting to watch  
bobby is button-downed , tightly-wound , always waiting for the next shoe -courtesy of ricky - to drop  
ricky is mostly oblivious to the problems he creates and is genuinely surprised when he comes under attack for his faux paus "
1,"hollywood has a  750 
batting average with elmore leonard adaptations  
last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies  
steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love  
george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth  
he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other  
nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style  
clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty  
clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun  
in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm  
of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good  
it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit

rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney  
he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie  
the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story "

1,"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style  
now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow  
this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows  
most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience  
that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema  
the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia  
it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine  
the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however  
after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did  "" 
drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets  
with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things  
october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston  
johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here  
he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust  
he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm  
his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father  
the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles  
laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need  
her role is instantly likeable  
chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie "
1,"upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be "" hellraiser meets the crow ""  
but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing "" the strangers "" and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked  
there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice  
i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character  
sutherland played the role as a true veteran  
upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography  
i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most  
the film flowed beautifully  
as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the "" dark city "" , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in "" the usual suspects ""  
not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy  
but if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor  
get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of "" 12 monkeys "" or "" the crow "" without the boredom or depression  
the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as "" 12 monkeys "" was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated  
and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of  
dark city simply puts "" spawn "" to shame  
in fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an "" akira "" -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie  
so my initial predictions were wrong  
this film is anything but the meloncholy of "" hellraiser "" parts one through five  
i'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city 
it's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects  
not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away "

1,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living  
he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings  
on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks  
fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt  
for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives  
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle  
alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility  
the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident  
the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it  
however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through  
he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger  
and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money  
however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money  
he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents  
he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner  
his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years  
she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for  
 "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her  
in his mind , his daughter is dead  
the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own "
1,"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is 100% intensity  
it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling  
 "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away  "" 
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 ""  
 "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real  
it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife )  
however , none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same "

1,"there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did  
 "" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me  
i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain  
the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter  
john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards  
russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema  
she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market  
crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager  
she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town  
much like "" fargo , "" this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick  
he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery  
along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , "" dale the thug "" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process  
there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down  
i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting  
this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should  
where as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , "" lucky numbers "" is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously  
it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that  
travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep  
he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill  
crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself "

it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in "" session 9  "" 
gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there

gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital  
as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital  
tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away  
but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all  
i don't want to give away too much of the story of "" session 9 , "" so i'll stop there  
what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of "" halloween "" and "" friday the thirteenth  "" 
there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror  
with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is "" frightening  ""

1,"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989  
whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed  
the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up  
someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition  
now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind  
the plot is thus  
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris )  
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u  s  nuclear submarine  
requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn )  
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren't speaking russian ""  
meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u  s  navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions  
this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them  
the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens  
the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding  
and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established  
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss "

thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman  
fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore  
with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life

when ali hollers "" damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind  
his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : "" no viet cong ever called me nigger "" , ali reasons  
despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of "" when we were kings "" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion  
listening to the film's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this "" rumble in the jungle "" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map  
spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a "" coming home "" to africa  
foreman reminds us that africa is the "" cradle of civilisation ""  
fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality  
it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator  
while ali respects mobutu's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers  
mailer's insights are lost on most of the film's commentators  
george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire  
with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire' s squalid ruling elite "
1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees  "
1,"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action  
mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year  
the film is based upon the comic book series "" the flaming carrot "" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear )  
things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city  
well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance  
this is where the film takes a turn for the better  
in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes  
 "" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , "" mr  furious ( ben stiller ) and "" the shoveller ( william h  macy )  
sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast  
that is until they aquire "" invisible boy "" ( kel mitchell ) , and "" the bowler "" ( janeane garafalo ) and "" mr  splein "" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess  
thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen  
the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest  
for one , the film is considerably clever  
it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc  in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way  
a part of the cleverness comes from the cast  
sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here "
1,
1,"i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan  
i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work  
breakdown , then , is something of a surprise  
russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film  
to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm  
russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life  
while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j  t  
walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck  
because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help  
that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her  
breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films  
as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller  
jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on  
when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little  
russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13  
j  t  
walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here  
the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable "
1,"plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes  
he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors  
oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? 
kewl ! 
critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare  
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations  
i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! 
i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well  
i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part  
plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest  
i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film  
i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys    you 
coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? )  
but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests  
this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either  
now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it  
visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton  
the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view )  
so overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring  
but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise  
ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house ! "" - 
type of thing ) "

1,"it must be tough to be a mob boss  
just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing  
i can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with  
suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help  
and who better than billy crystal  
after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here  
playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish  
casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think  
placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino  
it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so  
the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day  
ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors  
the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow )  
playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped  
the supporting cast sparkles  
joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure'  
the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides  
the situation is just too cute to resist  
it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand  
but hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally "
1,"if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it  
scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch  
it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store  
because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away  
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems  
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it  
harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly  
you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn  
the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet  
it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino  
once they get to mexico , it's time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper  
finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire  
soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back  
that's right , we've come all this way to see a vampire movie  
but like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment  
so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes "" a lap dog of satan  "" 
the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest  
clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously  
stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn  
pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment "
1,"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash  "" 
on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork  
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it )  
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 )  
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive  
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident "
1,"garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there  
shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle  
after a few disastrous "" mating "" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married  
the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the "" joys "" of married life  
despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? 
is a very funny movie  
the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well  
the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead  
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive  
plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? 
could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited )  
we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness  
i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of "" less is more ""  
the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film  
annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) 
does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor  
she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of "" high hopes "" for a lengthy period of time  
ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino    
good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy  
everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality

1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner  
in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making  
his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video  ) 
many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist  
it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power "

1,"in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid  
from that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years  
the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist  
the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen  
special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills "" verbal "" kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims  
kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead  
kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city  
along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible  
together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "" new york's finest taxi service "" --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins  
what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze  
the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater  
the cast is exceptional  
palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there  
byrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster  
del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny  
baldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm  
pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor  
however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey  
spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze  
spacey's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years "

1,"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer

1,"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies  
from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc  )  
when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? 
it just seemed cheap to me  
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude  
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie  
if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen  
this is part of the fun of watching scream  
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers  
to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film  
there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though  
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics  
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive  
from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories  
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream  
the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's  
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors "
1,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds  
that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon )  
but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way  
the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays  
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse  
the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty  
kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve  
he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him  
the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle  
the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin  
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back  
the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night  
on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again  
that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport  
in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him  
it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children  
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class  
they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child  
meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true  
he's finally rid of his family ! 
life is a dream come true "
1,"as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window  
after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter  
from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy  
home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally    more 
than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child )  
after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there  
this movie is a lot of fun  
it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy  
the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy  
one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes  
however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable  
this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that  
the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara  
she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work  
 ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away )  
rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant  
the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot  
if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance "

1,"i can hear the question already  
what on earth do these two movies have in common ? 
to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors  
as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers  
but oh , how differently the packages affect their films  
while "" everyone's "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is  
i left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face  
i left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less  
 "" everyone "" features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise  
woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again  
similar situations happen to his family and friends  
some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films  
the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut  
however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits  
in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important  
yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story  
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling  
and what better way to express feeling than through music ? 
love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart  
some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there  
it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him  
their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) "
1,"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x  when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them  
he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years  
 "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake  
we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides  
or at least , that's the intention  
the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him  
when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere  
coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair  
he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up  
he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle  
but danny won't  
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago  
the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white  
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on "
1,"`we run tings  
tings don't run we  ' 
-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell )  
jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay )  
capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him  
when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook )  
capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him  
torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again  
directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while  
shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are  
the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after )  
the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team  
the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest  
paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times  
mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together  
unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed  
the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others )  
the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review  
oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us  
at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) "
1,"most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy  
rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique  
the rocky formula of "" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight "" is carried out to the letter  
also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well  
this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become    
even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! 
then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan )  
a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr  t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he "" pities the fool "" for not coming out and fighting him outright  
rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn't listen  
naturally , he gets his ass kicked  
somewhere along the line after this several things happen  
rocky's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed  
rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight  
the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky  
guess who wins ? 
the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky'  
the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance  
the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film  
which is good if you like fighting scenes "
1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
 : - ) )  
well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here ? 
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance  
it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable  
there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming "
1,"mars attacks ! 
 ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j  fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones  
this is director tim burton's finest film to date  
many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films  
however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4  
you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film  
it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen  
once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix  
the plot is simple : martians invade the earth  
but it's different than any other invasion film  
usually it's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans  
this time however , it's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans  
the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i've seen in a long time  
they look funny , they move funny , and their "" language "" is hilarious  
and about the special effects  
the effects in mars attacks ! 
are just about the most flawless ones i've seen to date  
the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real  
there are just a couple of scenes that don't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship  
also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise  
but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood "
1,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult  
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives  
but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome  
`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood  
the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte )  
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface  
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me  
but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head  
we see that he is a mean-tempered person  
he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him  
he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence  
he also has tremendous problems with relationships  
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter  
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her  
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him  
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk  
she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point  
finally , he is spiteful and vindictive  
as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless  
as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died "
1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do  
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well  
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar  
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment "
1," "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline  
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter  
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally  
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on  
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  
directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses  
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  
the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close  
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche  
as such , there is no real story  
i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  
he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  
as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero  
he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him  
it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents )  
 "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life  
bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor  
he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig )  
bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning  
george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason "
1,"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club  
both films consist of a predominately male cast  
both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires  
and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped  
while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation  
a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire  
paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types  
as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology  
boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages  
another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks  
some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true  
if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend  
if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room  
giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth  
after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt )  
he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers  
learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true  
after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company  
at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on  
ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad "
1,"after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last  
redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera  
ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed  
while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with    um , 
realism , and i've never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing  
the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery  
scott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi  
grace's horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad  
annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace's newly-broken spirit  
eventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed "" horse whisperer "" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind  
eventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer  
the horse whisperer is delicately made  
i dare say lyrical , since to many people's ear , that word is synonymous with boring  
hardly  
the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story  
scott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d  p  
robert richardson's photography casts montana as heaven on earth "
1,"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents  
and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles )  
but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre  
and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires  
there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august  
the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method  
 ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart  ) 
blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate  
both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered  
when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum  
this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods )  
he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch  
he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a "" master "" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith )  
valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old  
apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime  
so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation  
the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year  
crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism  
baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy  
griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director )  
indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr  williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained  ) 
and , much like mr  tarantino's screenwriting , mr  williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr  williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel "
1,"the central focus of michael winterbottom's "" welcome to sarajevo "" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there  
it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( "" platoon "" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible "" the walking dead "" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( "" schindler's list "" )  
the two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false  
the question is not what went right  
the question is what went wrong  
for one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that's about it  )  
the assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter "" into "" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive  
the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison  
still , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music  
and it's a plus , because he doesn't toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness  
he wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious

atom egoyan's powerfully meditative "" the sweet hereafter "" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i've seen this year

1,"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats  
it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea  
sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other  
quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem  
but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors  
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists  
mostly it's laughable  
in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form  
but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right  
iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry  
but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u  s  as the legend of drunken master )  
unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression  
iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2  at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth  
iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger  
however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox  
in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience  
while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune "
1,"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system  
some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is  
however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear  
beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u  s  senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history  
bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party  
once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington  
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium     
blah , blah , blah  "" 
when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become  
in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place  
knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general  
at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u  s  unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife  "" 
later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule "
1,"at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie  
on second glance it looks that way too  
although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad  
admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure )  
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? "" 
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film  
sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team  
by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film  
 "" what disaster is that ? "" 
you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat  
glad you asked  
through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city  
the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel  
good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it  
sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside  
so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak  
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie  
not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again )  
daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star  
amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper  
oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too  
sage -- nice name "
1,"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia  
although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones  
until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters  
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times  
one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l  a  
the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot  
rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l  a  being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected  
richard chance ( william l  petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters  
however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another  
finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money  
being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier  
their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway  
like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life  
gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent  
that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood  
secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times "

1,"do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ? 
do you ? 
well , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring  
unfortunately , there's a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves  
a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo's character abby relates to it well  
like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that  
meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman    
uma being the only woman's name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies  
as abby tells her , "" you burp and they think it's cute  
you barf and they line up to hold your hair back  "" 
but nora's down on herself for being too shallow and superficial  
we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby's talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound  
 ( oh come on , any idiot knows how to handle that problem ! ) 
he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person  
abby , though , knows her body doesn't match her personality and that she probably won't have a chance with him once he sees her  
so she gives him nora's body description and stands him up  
nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor  
she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun , abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna  
the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful , she's not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person , but he doesn't suspect anything , realizing he's not living in a "" three's company "" episode  
the charade continues , with abby furthering the relationship over the phone ( including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex/masturbation sequence ) and nora furthering it in person , while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man  
like sleepless in seattle , this comedy/romance is predictable all the way through , but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom "

1,"capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers  
wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis  
what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? 
how much did he know about crimes against humanity ? 
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation  
 , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists  
szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope  
it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them  
ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich  
maj  steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor  
when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen  
after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes  
he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty  
from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra  
as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation  
there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting  
perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed  
if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth  
in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler  
where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous  
it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act "
1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open  
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful  
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy  
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated  
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog )  
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth  
tobey maguire fits well in the role  
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants "
1,"the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself  
but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things  
not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion  
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? 
that's basically how i felt about this movie  
i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either  
the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry )  
she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald    you 
know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * )  
thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen )  
near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods  
once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in )  
making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars  
one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role )  
they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal  
after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to "" take care "" of the problem  
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband  
but then one night , cole shows up  "
1,"i rented this movie with very high hopes  
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking  
first of all , the casting for this film is great  
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood  
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability  
william h  macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones  
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife  
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood  
joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom  
her character is the most ambitious  
she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that  
her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better  
as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance  
his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction  
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable  
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance  
the movie is very provocative "

1,"though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there's something about elizabeth    that 
left me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn't care about the characters  
to me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about  
and though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason  
elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying  
before she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs  
as a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england  
the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life  
much of the film deals with elizabeth's love for lord robert , a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen  
there is much ado about her lack of a husband , and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation  
the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece , as love interests are such a character driven element  
i didn't much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials  
the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen's most loyal advisor , sir francis , and attenborough as a well-meaning but old-fashioned lead council  
why then , you must be asking , do i recommend elizabeth ? 
simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer  
kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side  
the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches , cellars and castles in 16th century europe  
each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from windows  
the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot "

1,"what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ? 
to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion  
romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987  
however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot  
watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance  
then it hits them : they are not successful  
what are she and michele going to do ? 
romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , "" bag a couple of boyfriends , "" and get jobs  
romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it  
robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners  
one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales  
 "" i was so lucky getting mono , "" she says looking at her thinnest high school picture  
 "" that was like the best diet ever  "" 
the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed  
romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school  
the film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life  
at sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds )  
romy and michele were none of the above  
ridiculed as "" the weirdoes , "" they were constant targets for abuse  
even though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others  
that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them  
complementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney "

1,"the event of events is upon us  
people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it  
i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused  
it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history  
anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless  
it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic  
the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated  
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad  
in fact , it is terrific  
i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash  
it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place  
the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo  
the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate  
unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene  
on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  
he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi  
as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker  
>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie  
around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul  
i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this "
1,"ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start  
a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? 
with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? 
yuck  
but it's not really too bad  
it has a lot working against it , for me at least  
in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it  
it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable  
just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip  
through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity  
in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love  
the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples  
so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film )  
will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? 
will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? 
will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ? 
will they finally kiss ? 
well , what do you expect ? 
but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film  
pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show  
one word of caution , though  
this film is being billed in some places as a "" family "" movie  
don't let that stop you  
however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move  
after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions  
all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie  
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast "
1,"imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes  
so far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere  
it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness  
it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption  
the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing  
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job  
when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department  
minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops  
jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j  
t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner  
it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor  
jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight  
disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here  
there , trouble arises  
and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head  
there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam  
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff  
kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses  
so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect  
suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one "
1,"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers  
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture  
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's  
 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for  
smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal  
 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband  ) 
smart's got a point  
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version  
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later  
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman  
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb  
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv  ' 
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon  
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily  
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne  
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture  
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates  
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell  
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way  
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs  
larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s  
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky  
cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati  
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter  
this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history  
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost  
the people vs  
larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations  
considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs  
larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous  
much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity  
the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs  
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea  
larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side  
there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking  
ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other  
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt "
1,"after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino  
it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  
luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  
the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  
she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary  
but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope  
jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l  jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation  
soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda )  
also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say )  
the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands  
it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so  
there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters  
the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof  
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie  
a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? 
you've got to commend the acting  
jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting  
the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes  
tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  
also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear "
1,"in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it  
try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther  
in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps  
in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature  
there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich  
he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever  
the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello )  
simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall  
joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is  
naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball  
in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small  
joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends  
early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other  
both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability  
the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both  
finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show  
mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic  
the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by  ' 
along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions  
by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same "
1," "" crazy/beautiful "" suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome  
after a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story  
but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown "" afterschool special  "" 
even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to "" tone things down  "" 
needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated  
 "" we were trying to make a cautionary tale , "" he told newsweek , "" and we couldn't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from  "" 
regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes  
 "" crazy/beautiful "" is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for "" failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes  "" 
set in pacific palisades , calif  , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens  
every morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school  
an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy  
all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison )  
nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction  
carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile  
plus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral  
as with "" save the last dance , "" "" crazy/beautiful "" ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh  
while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though )  
the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there  
cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior "
1,"in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well  
yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it  
i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out  
it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering  
so , i shrugged , thought , "" hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , "" so i signed up  
all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either  
rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? 
you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey  
sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed  
when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out  
there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature  
in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors  
the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup  
subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled  
we meet all the important people    toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others  
we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons

there's plenty of attention to detail in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards  
the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story  
the various predicaments of the clock family are clever and thrilling  
based on an original story , the screenwriters did a good job at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person  
as the villain , john goodman's performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top  
but his performance suits the role well , and he does very well in the film's many slapstick moments  
with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are very well done  
there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief  
hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch "

the canadians can make a good movie  
the world is coming to an end  
we don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it  
the world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations  
yet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on  
they aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets  
instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end    
some engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone  
these people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours  
writer-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film  
all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth  
craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success  
even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer  
things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film  "
1,"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids  
although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind  
and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit  
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story  
nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a  k  a  robin hood  
flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself  
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household  
the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more  
i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review  
simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler  
robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch  
although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level  
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor  
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows  
in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country  
robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids  
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr  ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr  , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour  
whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly  
 ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag  ) 
double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs "
1,"what a great film  
what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film  
>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy  
a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way  
they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day  
heil ! 
heil ! 
huh ? 
shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces  
this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives  
granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece  
i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character  
benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race  
benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept  
it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema  
there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly  
slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed  
and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in  
this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family  
the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported  
guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child  
for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right  
for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds "

1,"i was anxious to see this for a long time  
a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is  
he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that  
scream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , "" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door  "" 
it's very familar , your typical horror film  
so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? 
because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff  
this raises another question : how does it do this ? 
simple : the characters  
they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette  
they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times  
you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed  
she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , "" what door am i at ? "" 
and that gets her killed  
that scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen  
the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis  
but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing  
that and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , "" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked  "" 
which is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter  
the cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive  
also good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( "" the fonz "" ) as the school principal  
i took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance  
i hate that show , i hate those actors "
1,"the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings  
involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done  
he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own  
marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel  
hank's reaction is one of amusement  
he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how  
the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be  
typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered  
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable  
from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama  
carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all  
the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum  
after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat

1,"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  
this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart  
in fact it's not even a comedy  
it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs  
based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness  
rob gordon was a dj  
it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life  
now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york  
when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose  
decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important  
he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists ""  
and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  
though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first  
where did he go wrong ? 
was it he that screwed up ? 
or maybe life just stinks ? 
while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together  
with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me  
although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word  
and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  
he is simply superb  
it is as much his movie as it is frears'  
the film would not be the same without him "
1," ( dimension films , "" scream 2 "" 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot  
that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first )  ) 
 "" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , "" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller "" scream , "" her statement referring to the films of the "" nightmare on elm street "" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general  
the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas  
but like it or not , along comes "" scream 2  "" and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions  
 "" scream 2 "" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride  
it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california  
those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives  
plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along  
trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called "" stab  "" 
and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during "" scream , "" has left his job as a police officer for a while  
life is tranquil    
at least for a while  
several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one  
thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student  
cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? 
like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang  
this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of "" stab , "" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema "
1," "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold  "" 
starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong 
eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love  
neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough  
and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films  
slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york  
when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver  
he does not seem particularly out of place  
in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home  
he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they're american ) --the tokens of his success  
he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb )  
he loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village  
when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father  
all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl  
but eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable  
director mabel cheung ( an autumn's tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home  
slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language  
seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home  
the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic  
on his way to his parent's village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man  
slim and odds-and-ends fall for each other "
1,"james l  brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy  
nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen  
he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone  
so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t  v 
sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 )  
naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end  
like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy  
nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish  
only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers  
hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson  
there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them  
kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character  
although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together  
in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson  
but then again , pets are always cute on screen  
providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun  
he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying  
smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role

mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for  
i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals  
sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's "" all that jazz "" and "" cabaret , "" but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from "" the rocky horror picture show "" and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols

but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending  
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
yes , it's all about the suits , fellas    the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but that's not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other  
you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is , their boss

1,"it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film  
films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio  
the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films  
the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut  
for years , i have heard of an "" international "" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years  
i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on  
but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it  
until now  
the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello  
he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops  
one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries  
taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life  
mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a "" cleaner  "" 
she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession  
at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in  
the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed "" too explicit  "" 
i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle  
the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops  
there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe  
with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version "

1,"billed as a "" feminist sex fantasy "" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions  
camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence  
however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance  
political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton )  
in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss  
this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality  
in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it  
when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her  
these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence  
god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a "" her "" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction  
this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances  
making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame  
hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents  
it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of "" boogie nights "" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry  
making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie  
the other performances are equally solid  
daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role  
shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut  
overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed  
at one point , the title character declares that "" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work "" "

he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers

robocop takes place in detroit in the future  
things are pretty bleak  
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force

peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed  
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter  
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after  
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace  
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting  
the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop

1,"it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste  
indeed  
while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration  
i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied  
henry fool ( "" used to have an ? e' "" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been "" exiled and marginalized "" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity  
simon's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its "" pornographic "" content  
meanwhile , henry seduces both simon's dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust  
these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself  
henry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from "" udderley's "" ; the big teen hang-out is called "" world of donuts "" ; simon wears his garbageman's uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical    
 ( which is key to the conclusion's said ambiguity )  
the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously "" quirky "" ; the introductory scenes are a chore  
these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren't pop slackers  
the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of  
 ( shades of film school    ) 
the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length

summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  
if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you  
melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible  
his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk  
 ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles  ) 
melvin has some great lines  
when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability  "" 
don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist  
setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  
when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute

1,"warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it  
while i don't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing )  
but , in a nutshell , it's a good film  
star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim 
never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace  
however , it can't be ignored  
endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult  
with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations  
thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better  
while the "" first "" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader )  
without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it  
the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat  
common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects  
still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for  
hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the "" improvements "" in the special editions )  
there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious "" pod race "" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in "" ben hur "" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids  
utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail  
no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new  
the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans  
best described as an mr  bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show "

they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them  
he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over  
so he turns to his "" best "" friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success  
on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ? 
when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success  
 "" she doesn't do any actual writing , "" he is told , "" but inspires you  "" 
steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client  
jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's  
after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night  ) 
steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon  
steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life  
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her  
and that's a question only time will tell  
 "" the muse "" is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( "" defending your life "" and "" mother "" )  
the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners  
it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential  
but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit  
he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy  
and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her  
and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese "

once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married  
the truth is he isn't married  
to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife  
the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film  
buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events  
gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals  
the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits  
gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house

1,"the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz  
all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game  
the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it  
in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus  
in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game  
in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices  
there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated  
the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make  
rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds  
after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only  
the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days  
all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? 
douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller  
along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol  
the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests  
i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film  
unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened  
the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , "" what is the point of this ? "" 
sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true  
i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is  
on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl  
in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances "
1,"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates  
geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery  
needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 
i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan )  
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? )  
bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 
this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  
it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema  
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  
oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books )  
but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show  
along with the pig , of course ! 
anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  
there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine  
he succeeds , but    she 
knocks the glass over ! 
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !

1,"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism  
everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time

others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work  
and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line  
receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy , "" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her  
he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses  
his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science  
that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming  
he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins  
the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , "" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "" 
she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored  
geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life  
while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area  
in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything  
the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle  
it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies  
that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point  
the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters  
geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty  
alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment  
geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him  
the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely "

1,"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story  
it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film  
but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy  
driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago  
the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union  
uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza  
the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur  
the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action  
in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together  
rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on  
the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr  martin luther king , jr  
the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway  
the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur  
freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke  
the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger  
driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon  
daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur  
initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere  
once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver "

[expectations - medium] 
long review =========== 
i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film  
i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be "" fluff  "" 
however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending  
 ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad  ) 
story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in  
alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very "" parodyish  "" 
 ( okay , bad term  ) 
extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle  
acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important  
however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more "" canadian "" type of mode  ) 
carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne  
tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted  
lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about  
without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way  
direction : spheeris is a classic "" music "" movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years  
 ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least  ) 
she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc "
1,"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality  
but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations  
it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation  
in addition , it's also a terrific family film  
this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools  
it could also be described as `mrs  
streep's opus'  
yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad  
out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view  
she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? 
slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied  
one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven  
after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama  
at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material  
it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr  
holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth  
the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate  
yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work  
angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience  
blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest  
gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force "

1,"city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental  
i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality  
city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years  
it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this  
city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire  
i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two  
i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material  
nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it )  
one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr  maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her  
the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch )  
he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status  
seth wants to become human so he can feel her  
that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race  "" 
 ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death  ) 
messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human  
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel  
this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead  
since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect  
although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre "

1,"earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics  
a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience  
now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter  
there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing  
the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland  
ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed  
enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village  
the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud  
ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael  
jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man  
the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience  
every viewer is sure to like both of them  
there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer  
this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary  
overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously  
the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout  
the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff  
in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial  
it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes  
there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one "
1,"based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal  
now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all  
his latest challenge is his biggest though    he 
must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires  
admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some  
judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film  
to some degree , i agree with this sentiment  
having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade  
 ( "" men in black "" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) 
why is this ? 
for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand 
the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match  
the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided  
the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect  
superman 
is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this  
blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere  
this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show  
batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready )  
which brings me back to blade  
although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon  
the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that 
uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends "
1,"catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up  
she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life  
as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties  
a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls  
just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia  
the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  
in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    
a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! 
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  
while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  
the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  's "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory  
despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  
all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  
the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room "
1," "" a breed apart "" casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner  
a bit hard to swallow ? 
that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film  
hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector  
turner is the woman caught between the two men  
 "" a breed apart "" isn't a bad movie , exactly  
indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different  
the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies  
for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at "" his "" birds  
later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them  
i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point  
another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops  
i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner  
i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions  
however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds  
as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired  
he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters  
and this one is no exception  
he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow  
despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through  
for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early "
1,"labelling is sometimes everything  
in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own  
walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors  
producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones  
on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america  
to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago  
instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city  
the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx  
that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce  
on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city  
crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus  
police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs  
the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs  
upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status  
however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year  
the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly  
if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably  
the future was much worse than his vision  
the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities  
their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime "
1,"the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films  
one was _gattaca_  
the other was _the thirteenth floor_  
just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_  
however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_  
a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered  
his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery  
along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture  
_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise  
the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view  
first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline  
second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel  
no wonder it fell through the cracks  
done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels  
many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment  
i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie  
despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller  
in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever  
the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging  
in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one "
1,"'lake placid' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever  
actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film  
well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are  
i will admit that 'lake placid' isn't an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny  
bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half  
she gets there but really doesn't understand why she is there  
bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on  
what they find though isn't great  
a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why  
they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from  
betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you'll have to see the movie to find out  
her character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny  
to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws  
with the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is  
when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it  
david e  kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job  
the characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners  
but believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it  
but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun 'popcorn' type movie "
1,"titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year  
and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the "" big summer releases "" were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
it's my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said "" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to  "" 
truer words are hard to come by  
of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc  still care to disagree ? 
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
it's obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant "
1,"towards the middle of "" the sweet hereafter , "" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight  
then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field  
it pauses for a moment before the "" field "" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time  
compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of "" titanic , "" when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films  
the scene in "" the sweet hereafter "" epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film  
it's not sensational  
we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about  
the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces  
it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake  
it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance  
using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy  
fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief  
the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit  
stephens , who "" doesn't believe in accidents , "" functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath  
while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss  
his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years  
egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry  
mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for "" the ice storm , "" contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles  
equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room  
 "" the sweet hereafter , "" while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go "
1,"in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn't everything  "" 
i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film  
see , spoofs are easy with me  
i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love  
sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing  
sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter )  
sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film  
abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me  
it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything  
there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness  
i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking  
most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense  
mafia ! 
has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh  
the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino  
our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire  
to describe the story of mafia ! 
is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout  
along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing  
movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction  
abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! 
to his experience  
he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) "
1,
1,"whew  this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days  
like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control  
the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message  
the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle )  
bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate  
not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus  
you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name  
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message  
one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly  
it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot  
distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view  
you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens  
this film camera is just another one of the guys  
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across  
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares  
i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be  
that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted  
if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film  
stay at home and rent up close and personal "
1," "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him  "" 
starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood  
rated r  
double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable  
it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  
there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops  
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  
not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake  
we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4  they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep  
libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  
she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up  
at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  
her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling  
her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  
once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend  
her friend gives her son the phone  
nick walks in the room  
little matty screams "" daddy ! "" 
the phone goes dead  
libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead "
1,"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j  fox )  
george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane )  
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat )  
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi )  
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak )  
it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m  night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video

1," "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 
okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  
it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  
much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts  
all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend  
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends  
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight )  
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  
i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  
just fill in the blanks ! 
can you see it ? 
 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  
we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues   "
1," "" seven "" is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen  
it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun  
it's a serial killer mystery , but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer  
the story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery  
someone is murdering people who are offenders of "" the seven deadly sins  "" 
a fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions    
i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much  
what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the "" good guys "" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile  
brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie  
however , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn't get killed by the end )  
there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief  
this is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment  
the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be  
the production design is superb , in the spirit of "" batman "" and "" the crow , "" this film embodies the gothic mood  
the way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! 
the killer's victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case  
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense  
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown  
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this "
1," "" i know what you did last summer , "" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996's "" scream , "" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997's biggest hit of the fall season  
while "" scream "" was a more knowing film about the genre , "" i know what you did last summer "" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the "" friday the 13th "" films ( well , okay , "" jason goes to hell "" was pure hell to sit through )  
the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n  c  
it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways  
kind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr  ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player  
when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home  
distraught and confused , they decide they can't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him  
julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry  
switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out  
almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , "" i know what you did last summer , "" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook  
 "" i know what you did last summer , "" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons  
the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings  
the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort  
and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her  
perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit  
heche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time  
 "" i know what you did last summer , "" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems

1,"life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless  
it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie  
it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you  
subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience  
life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle  
the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi )  
their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man  
can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? 
what do you think ? 
however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy  
the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp  
unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp  
he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet  
as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them  
as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny  
as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching  
roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why  
he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's "" triumph of the underdog "" spirit  
life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust  
however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears  
with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy  
it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year "

1,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant  
in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc  ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised ? 
well , so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace ""  
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs "
1,"there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days  
stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? 
he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen  
and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri  
now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl  
there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially  
ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting  "" 
the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs  
 "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit  
a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah  "" 
as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance  
unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance  
one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s  burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave  "" 
stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills  
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed  
 "" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l  a  to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings  
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time  
janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor "
1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios "
1,"of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom 
the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film  
there's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women  
as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy  
it's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on  
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash  
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow  
various mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow  
but if you think you've been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o  russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension  
the dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn't got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech  
whether it's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention  
the best thing is how these words aren't just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they're said in character , like tea leoni's neurotically-charged psychobabbler who's able to say under assault , "" it's understandable if you find this threatening ""  
the cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission  
there are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes )  
like allen , russell's interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really )  
still , if you're expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la "" murphy brown "" / "" frasier "" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won't happen  
the film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character's search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down  
if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster's charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go  
and that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it  
somehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end "
1,"along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view  
for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart  
the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role  
accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood  
it was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face  
braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film  
for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest  
the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries  
seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland  
as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up  
his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son  
however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought  
braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays  
mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast  
patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank  
the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good  
sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart  
i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace  
however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor  
the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is "
1,"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us  
president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days  "" 
one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown  
that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962  
now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history  
taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p  o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war  
as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems  
meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment  
suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat  
where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project  
there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen  
it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation  
the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner  
costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family  
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know  
kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more  
the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though  
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels  
the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia "
1,"gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit  
in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years  
without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated  
 "" the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond  
it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions  
the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other  
annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown  
some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father  
for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future  
her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that  
when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to  
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about  
at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole )  
soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home  
 "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches  
slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery  
at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's "" the talented mr  ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her  
blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had  
we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress "
1,"swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults  
steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie  
and he knows a money making winner when he sees one  
the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster  
hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro  
a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife  
the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead  
however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro  
banderas motive ? 
to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie  
with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners  
banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease  
hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work  
as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way  
the audience does hate them , which can't be bad  
catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance  
the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones  
there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together  
the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly  
the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well  
the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding "

1,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages  
martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime  
unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies  
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime  
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s  
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film )  
the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york  
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands  
after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro )  
three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history  
wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business  
but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends  
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory  
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating  
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny  
after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens  
scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience  
with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era  
even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker "
1,"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen  
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse  
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet  
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa  
his films all seem to have one style , bleak  
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold  
little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver  
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid  
his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with  
cure is probably his classic  
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon  
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story  
pulse is kurosawa back on form

1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever  
so it is about time he made another film  
and what a ride it is  
the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better  
overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty  
it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end  
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight  
unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false  
however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent  
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view

1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information  
generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s  , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government "
1,"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen  
i finished mike figgis' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr  
alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude ""  
 "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore  
ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk  
his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor  
in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of  
he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid  
when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable  
after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says "" i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again  "" 
now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben  
there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye  
it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy  
now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with  
once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death  
one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since "" adventures in babysitting "" ) named sera  
she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her  
they are both very lonely , self-destructive people  
they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another  
and it isn't even a sexual relationship "
1,"i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating "" comedy "" of chris tucker  
i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well  
it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  
the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  
this time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? )  
the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  
of course , it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way  
rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  
i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  
he refuses to shut up  
not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head , but his jokes just aren't funny , a pathetic mixture of sub-par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  
i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn't anyone realize how irritating tucker's incessant ranting and raving was ? 
if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films  
fortunately , chan makes for a marvelous straight man , and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  
it's not often that one actor can so completely save a movie , but there is no other name for what he does ; whenever he's on screen , rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking , often hilarious , life  
much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a "" player , "" but who cares ? 
i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  
the movie ends with outtakes that , as usual , show that chan isn't perfect , and that it does , indeed , take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  
chris tucker botches some lines as well , and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  
a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style  
but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  
director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) "

1,"after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story  
as the film warns us at the beginning , it's not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea  
the only thing missing is charlton heston  
instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren  ) 
we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up  
moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn't really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule  
he soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer  ) 
rameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task  
while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen  
gone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot  
but , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen  
jeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested  
he's included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested  
and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring  
it's a remarkable achievement  
also remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost 'slap dash' effort , to shame  
relying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed  
the film seems a little caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and 'moving' shots , but they _do_ look incredible  
the final 'plague' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed  
kudos to the animators "
1,"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world  
the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters  
mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , 
mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say  
the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation  
the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation  
mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place  
mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery  
yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy  
the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b  d  
wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father  
also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman  
his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters  
the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners  
the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot  
the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus  
mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame  
at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end  
mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain  
also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production "
1,"no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life  
but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is  
 "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is  
the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given )  
it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams  
in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world  
after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life  
taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself  
but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker  
another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher  
she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge )  
several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least    ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile  
because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on  
if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on    
the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world "
1,"david lynch's "" blue velvet "" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town  
however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a "" strange world "" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers  
the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film  
they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances  
odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story  
thankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable  
since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next  
this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising  
 "" blue velvet "" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting  
lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling  
the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan )  
from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping  
the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing  
maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends  
through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots  
lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion  
instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times  
lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine  
however , for fans of odd difficult indies , "" blue velvet "" could be just what they are looking for  
it is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper's sadistic frank "
1,"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original  
one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one  
its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day  
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience  
one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time  
it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g  epstein , philip j  epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director  
however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film  
until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age  
the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story  
in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government  
thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas  
many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains )  
his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody ""  
however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas  
this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca  
one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe  
he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris  
the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail "
1,"steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film  
spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries  
he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle  
for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , "" saving private ryan "" is flawless  
literally  
the plot is simple enough  
after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt  john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt  
james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle  
once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home  
accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational  
barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home  
the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary  
literally  
there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes  
spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection  
the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan  
there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences  
this is what coppola was looking for in "" apocalypse now "" , but couldn't create  
the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war "
1,"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull )  
roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film  
i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it  
the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter  
the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) )  
one can almost sense the cold  
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better  
this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots  
the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true  
this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed  
in the plane three men find ? the american dream    
in a gym bag  ? 
affliction too was set in a snowy landscape  
it really seems very simple  
just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true  
but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes  
as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing  
but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish "
1,"hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest )  
it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters  
i mean , come on  
are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? 
hell no  
and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films  
and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either  
this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu  
i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays  
and that is exactly what this film is ; art  
i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers  
let me backtrack a minute  
when i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved  
with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown  
those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen  
you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore  
this is a thinking man's slasher flick  
the "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy  
he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder )  
upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's )  
the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck "

what danger is a bear , to a message ? 
i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth  
but all that has changed now  
the guy has grown up  
and that's not all  
it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication  
one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper  
but , no  
this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple  
penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash  
the focus of the story is two brothers  
david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer  
viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve  
the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line  
it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared  
the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere  
it isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them  
life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems  
this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face "

martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt  
roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? 
let's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! 
the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye  
new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective  
trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception  
even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship  
we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen  
gunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord  
although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action  
and there's plenty of action here for two movies  
led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to  
li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives  
there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore  
it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun  
but even too many explosions can get boring  
to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li  
luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns  
meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets  
everybody gets in on the shtick  
russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones "

1,"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon  
here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life  
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution  
i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? 
as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior  
in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything  
but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison  
a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs  
in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining  
i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months  
it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker  
the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers  
just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead  
flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them  
he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance )  
flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position  
the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation  
created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen  
the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action  
this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc  ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative "
1,"roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor  
however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed  
maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed )  
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking  
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    
it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting  
it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective  
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed  
many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on    
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  
we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though  
there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing

1,"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r  so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself  
 "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades  
it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant  
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen  
regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be  
the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason  
it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex  
as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all  
but , that's the movie  
now back to the preview  
prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv )  
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing  
hmmmmm  
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone  "" 
hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day

1,"the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs  
doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting  
it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive  
his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster  
and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams  
williams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting  
we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies  
it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people  
he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade  
his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board  
the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense  
although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters  
at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity  
the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why  
monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school  
for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view  
the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way  
the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid  
director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring  
patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time "
1,"before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet  
it is the latest entry in this decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film , and the first of two "" the sky is falling "" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat )  
its tagline , "" oceans rise  
cities fall  
hope survives "" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( "" they came in alone    the only way out    
is together "" ) , but it's every bit as treacly  
the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at  
the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening "" roll call , "" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced  
the most prominent of the "" personal "" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt )  
what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc's cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film's ostensible main character  
in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country  
the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante's peak , but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder  
she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises  
the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic  
having passed the "" er challenge "" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen "
1,"with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? 
based on the book by author james ellroy , l  a  confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years  
together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through  
set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities  
jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention  
there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father  
the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way  
3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil  
when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder  
even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder  
the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood  
the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects  
in l  a  confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it  
there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all  
surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe  
pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance  
crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here "
1,"plot : good ol' texan kid suddenly gets to play first-string quarterback on his high school team's football team , in a town where football is considered religion  
the coach is just about the biggest a-hole you'd ever want to meet , who will do practically anything to win  
the good ol' texan boy does not approve of said man's methods  
critique : a fun football movie  
this film was obviously geared towards the teen market , with mtv behind its production , a big tv star actor in the lead role , rockin' hip music galore , and plenty of t&a  
having said that , i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie , thought james van der beek gave a solid performance , loved the slick sounds , and yup , loved that t&a ! 
i actually thought this was a comedy going in , but overall , it plays more towards the dramatic , than a comedy  
i also enjoyed jon voight's performance as the stubborn dick coach , as well as many of the other character players on the team  
this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination , but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the "" fun "" game of football , or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and forty-five minutes in the movie theatre ( or in the comfort of their own home , depending on where you watch this stuff  ) 
all in all , i would definitely watch this movie if you like football , play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football  
you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff  
and did i mention the t&a ? 
 : ) 
little known facts about this film and its stars : james van der beek actually started acting after a concussion stopped him from playing football in real life  
he is the oldest of three children , and his father is a cellular phone salesman while his mom runs a gymnastics studio  
he's born in connecticut and received $200 , 000 for his role in this film  
actor scott caan , who plays football player "" tweeder "" in this film , is the son of famed actor james caan in real life  
that's right , he's sonny's son ! 
actress amy smart , who plays van der beek's girlfriend in this movie , also played the main star's girl in the 1999 film outside providence ( 6  5/10 )  
screenwriter w  peter iliff also had a part in writing the screenplays for the 1992 harrison ford film , patriot games , and the keanu reeves surfing flick , point break  
director brian robbins might be best remembered as the "" cool dude "" from the tv series "" head of the class ""  
his name was eric mandrian and he generally wore a long , black trench coat on the show "

 "" how do you know when you're finished making love ? "" 
-jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting 
jackson pollock's "" making love "" quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , "" it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means  "" 
it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept  
the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art  
arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema  
 ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success  ) 
granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing  
the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions  
and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion  
_pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression  
a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush  
in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , "" you paint the fucking thing , "" and leaves in a huff  
by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision  
 ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance  ) 
such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does  
while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : "" you are killing me ! 
you are killing me ! 
you are killing me ! "" 
 ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim  ) 
pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth  
i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well  
it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images "

1,"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze  
i liked showgirls ( there , i said it )  
i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash  
wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen  
it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards  
criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic  
wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies  
i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal  
i imagine that this shows  
it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known  
i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here  
i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida  
in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges  
all of this happens fairly early in the film  
and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted  
i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked  
wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks  
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers  
i'd give the preview four stars "
1,"every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars "" sur-prise ! "" 
into my bewildered visage  
it's almost always a surprise  
it sure as niflheim was this time  
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  
and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy , i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash  
another e  t  
another short circuit  
this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time  
america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? )  
amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama  
this is a very sturdy scenario  
the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role  
the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the "" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen "" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! 
astounding ! 
he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! 
i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film  
i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons  
his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , "" amazing "" grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world  
let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply  
i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence  
no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc  screw what i think "
1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students "
1," "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds  
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score  
dah-dum  
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip  
perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie  
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act  
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  
until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music  
he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying  
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery  
the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  
brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  
hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying  
when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark  
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it  
 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror  
it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) "

1,"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out  
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact  
 "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making  
it has altered the way films will be viewed  
 "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count  
sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s  
in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic )  
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay  
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already  
the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine  
the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's  
they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  
after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment ""  
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell ""  
i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win  
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge  
previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  
as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent "
1,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable

one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom

loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  
at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  
it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? ""  
wings of desire this ain't  
since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors  
 ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden  ) 
his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another  
dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition "

running time : 88 minutes 
 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving  
it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too  
it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute  
deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it  
though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get  
he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip  
trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets  
the thing is now he has to try and find $6 , 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again

with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is sometimes like last years hit "" there's something about mary "" that is offensive but very funny  
the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart , clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny  
the characters in the film are all actually likable especially "" jabba lady "" with her big body but soft heart

1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging  
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil  
it's just sad  "" 
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears  
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house  
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills  
she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down  
 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts  
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 
worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone "
1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen  
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it  
it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world  
it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and    well , it's just an _experience_  
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation    and 
it's about to do so again  
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now "
1,"he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother  
she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus  
he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases  
he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door  
he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit  
he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc  , etc  then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears  
his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion  
unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out  
he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts  
soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest  
bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable  
the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom  
bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind  
so far , so good  
the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant  
the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe  
it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins  
it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes "
1," "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made  
it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout  
this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly  
harrison ford stars as dr  richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife  
the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner  
we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective  
hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered  
we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story  
in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves  
the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story  
one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck  
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch  
this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable  
tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u  s  marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives  
from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur  
kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other  
most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife "
1,"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people  
in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy  
in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer  
even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love  
in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character  
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up  
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  
booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident  
the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg  
annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker  
at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work  
instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest )  
in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically  
the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs  country  
in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor  
the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people  
redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago  
in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains  
but then , that would ruin the magic "
1,"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane  
billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble  
christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books  
he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports  
jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus  
and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases  
the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr  weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium  
during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan  
the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast  
the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another  
henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game  
the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other  
michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity  
as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh  
although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing  
while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special  
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance  
his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character  
lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character "
1,"bruce barth's mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida  
ulee's gold feels like another fonda creation- on golden pond : it has a soft , calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath , the cinematography creates a place of gold , yellow , and olive colors , the music is stirring and tranquil  
both deal with the hardships of family life  
peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention  
nu ? ez is probably independent film's greatest asset , along with john sayles , and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating , heavy tension  
peter fonda's performance borrows from his father henry fonda's in on golden pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father , peter fonda is quiet , emotional , and weary in this exceptional role  
ulee jackson , the film's protagonist , is struggling  
pressure is mounting at the wrong time  
he is a beekeeper and this is his "" busy "" season  
he has to deal with his two granddaughters' needs and erupting hormones , he is forced to pick up his daughter-in-law in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her , and he is faced with a challenging task : unsettled business his son , who is now in prison , has left behind  
he finds his daughter-in-law , helen , with the two men his son robbed a bank with  
she has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband  
that is why he got caught- the police found him with the money  
now the two men are demanding they get the cash , or they will come after ulee's two granddaughters  
ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt  
ulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his platoon to survive  
he refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures  
he is a bitter , closed-off man whose only passion is his beekeeping , his granddaughters , and his dead wife  
connie , his next door neighbor , finally gets through to him with friendly favors  
she is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs "

1,"wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say  
this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie  
the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home  
he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law  
time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement  
by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards  
wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact  
who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? 
somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! 
still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff  
his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of "" nothing counts as much as blood  "" 
equally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) 
sequence that is decidedly non-pc  
director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay  
the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics  
don't look for much glorified violence here  
despite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life  
the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! )  
kevin costner is very good in the title role  
dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch  
he was tougher in a perfect world  
his foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday

1,"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france  
when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix  "" 
writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre  
their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself  
felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends  
when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away  
felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot  
he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny  
along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations  
on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police  
following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family  
his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix  
they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on  
he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to  
she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father  
in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles  
he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister  "" 
he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would  
on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son

1,"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan  
i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form  
in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster  
said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner  
when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning  
throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film )  
but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify  
we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect  
a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture  
the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident  
i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera  
for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people  
but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much  
also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue  
perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner  
there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers  
i was half-right  
nevertheless it's worth-seeing  
the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed  
the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) "
1,"there was a lot riding on this movie  
everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end  
what would be the "" final act "" ? 
this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves  
no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co  
so , how does the story go ? 
as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems  
she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone  
but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off  
instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him  
the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two  
not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette )  
at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional  
nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene  
so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing  
sometimes both  
clever , indeed  
but , who goes next ? 
no one knows  
three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the "" scream "" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read  
still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly  
when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through "" woodsboro , "" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of "" scream 3 "" ? ? ? s finest moments  
okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the "" scream "" fan "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous "
1,"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen  
in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven  
his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of  
that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage  
the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far    
with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator  
luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie  
talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career  
his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona  
he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey  
he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however  
ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show  
quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer  
unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! 
also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia  
she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her  
the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy  
the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film  
peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun "
1,"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction  
since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn  
in between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances  
now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown  
and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed  
for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie  
the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses  
and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet  
yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown  
the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent  
the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives  
and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around  
there's a samuel l  jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it  
jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives  
this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire  
however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional  
had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost  
as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity

that a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york's cardshark underground astoundingly doesn't limit its accessibility , even for those who can't tell royal and straight flushes apart  
 "" rounders "" ' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with  
the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don't have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show  
matt damon , fresh off his "" good will hunting "" hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling  
but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind  
things change , however , when mike's old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the debt  
that "" rounders "" ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency  
director john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs "" red rock west "" and "" the last seduction , "" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm  
damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be worth catching even if "" rounders "" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning  
any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight  
if only the other character interaction was as successful , "" rounders "" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year's best films  
current "" it girl "" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike's girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective  
john turturro's aging mentor and famke janssen's tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time  
and as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for "" rounders "" ' moral  
that moral , by the way , is "" our destiny chooses us , "" and it's something of a surprise when "" rounders "" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be  
in the end , "" rounders "" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture  
the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be  
here , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren't cut out for the cards  
screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that's often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene "
1,"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men  
blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it  
it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well  
although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie  
the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story  
but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once  
that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit  
blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire  
his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire  
including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust  
blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother  
but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films  
the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires  
where do vampires get money ? 
well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations  
i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie  
blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community  
he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority  
he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable  
it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire  
admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through "
1,"mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in town , and he's the nameless animal attraction of "" mouse hunt , "" dreamworks skg's clever first foray into family fare  
although it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog    
but consider that list includes dismal tripe like "" air bud , "" "" flubber "" and "" that darn cat , "" and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull off  
still , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i'll be hoping that the mouse from "" mouse hunt "" knocks some sense back into mickey  
nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from "" the birdcage "" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in "" the fifth element "" ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion  
although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect  
but there's a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight  
movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite  
the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless  
the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of "" the nightmare before christmas , "" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from "" edward scissorhands  "" 
 "" mouse hunt "" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it's hardly ever mean-spirited  
the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse  
it's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick  
vicki lewis ( beth from "" newsradio "" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife  
and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a "" calcium deficiency  "" 
blech  
a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution  
their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don't think i'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share "
1,"after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? 
what made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? 
was it the tunes from sinatra , etc  , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? 
was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? 
the charisma of the two leads ? 
even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances  
i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such  
which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider  
it was traditional , magical  
we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in  
it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings  
the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction  
from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the "" return to me "" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet  
the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy  
real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice  
we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence  
the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal  
everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film  
>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes  
from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints  
from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part  
 "" return to me "" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist  
we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father  
whatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors "
1," "" living out loud , "" is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds  
judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately  
she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her  
she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club  
judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently  
both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends  
 "" living out loud , "" which was written by richard lagravenese ( "" the bridges of madison county "" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant  
the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself  
one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen  
sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching  
one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel  
an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends  
as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them  
instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends  
holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here  
hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's "" the piano , "" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think  
she finds the right note for each scene and holds it  
and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about  
usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play  
topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model "
1,"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds  
this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper  
from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale  
although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye  
while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community  
the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world  
the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way  
their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone  
shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey  
courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself  
whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment  
but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage  
he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them  
secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor  
throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona  
an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona  
children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist  
after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance  
surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night  
in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self "
1,"a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark's migration from the "" good vibrations "" and "" calvin klein undie ad "" guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that

parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy  
girl steps to boy's defense

critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? 
well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you  
it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes )  
i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7  5/10 )  
he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards )  
the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots    if 
you're into that kind of thing , that is : ) "
1,"a big surprise to me  
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope  
they replaced him just fine  
not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing  
the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten  
this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed )  
things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all  
i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing  
there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops  
it's just the music  
one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this  
the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job  
the only real problems i had was the special effects  
these were superfluous and a waste of money  
since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see  
the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide

1,"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed    all while still alive  
recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy  
problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice    
walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good  
the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all  
they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi  
the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed )  
unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres  
on one hand , it is a fast paced action film  
on the other , it's a frightening horror film  
and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy  
ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson )  
the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner  
if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible  
and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies "
1,"i don't box with kid gloves  
i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film  
i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic  
however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery  
rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time  
i still , however , will not go easy on them  
they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film  ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it  
in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets  
well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence  
the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me  
sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable  
down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report  
like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail  
the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s  
a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell  ' 
in down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent  
with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters  
again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about  
the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) "

jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time  
rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping  
thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy    
this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia  
the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly  
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story  
it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating  
this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough  
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective  
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency  
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable  
the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie  
part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast "
1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise  
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order  
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force  
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut "

or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets  
at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f "" times new roman "" \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie )  
verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing  
he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like "" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist "" ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book )  
we see the story unfold as spacey retells it  
the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car  
it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse  
namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash  
spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent "" cripple "" character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast  
the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion  
i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv  
a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again   "
1,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented )  
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise  
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  
there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there  
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict  
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist  
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely  
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right  
the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling  
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone  
the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him  
in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc  until after we've observed them for a while  
but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story  
eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police  
we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time  
two other important characters are also introduced : dr  daniel p  schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies  
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film "
1,"dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station  
she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states  
she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts  
she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring  
totally trustworthy , right ? 
not a chance  
once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra )  
one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father  
shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned  
days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament  
through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father  
this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace  
films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films  
it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own  
it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly  
and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that  
the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental  
the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film  
dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals  
but neither side is trivialized  
she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially "
1,"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now  ? 
it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film "
1,"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 
right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song  
the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field  
it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio  
a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films  
their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo  "" 
in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people  
ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department  
but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1  2 million  
their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money  
there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens  
the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow  
some of the interludes are an epiphany , though  
the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root )  
they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow  "" 
it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year  
contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother  "" 
in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched  
the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz  "" 
they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" 
and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here "

1,"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it  
probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's  
however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made  
corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  
her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion  
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  
they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  
lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  
this is not clear to lucas , however  
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen  
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  
they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie  
surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school  
the next scene is brilliant  
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  
he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion  
in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters  
but maggie is written smarter than that "
1,"after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america  
muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia  
she is often the target of her father's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage  
her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired  
after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel's wedding unfolds from there  
toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted  
collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character  
she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance  
collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene  
muriel's father , bill "" the battler "" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer  
while chumming around with young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments  
rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel's cheeky new friend in the film  
she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen  
muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting 
muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm  
hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile  
hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her  
the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch  
muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p  j  hogan "

1," "" the celebration "" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant  
you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs  
i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like  
i don't really feel there are to be any real "" rules "" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work  
but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences  
when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me  
 "" the celebration "" is great because it's chock full of those  
it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life  
and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up  
the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him  
all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here )  
the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home  
his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable  
we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to  
once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age  
but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch  
twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends  
the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion  
as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose "" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability "" so that they may "" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot  "" 
i have not seen "" breaking the waves , "" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but "" the celebration "" works exquisitely in this department "
1,">from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6  5/10 ) 
comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast  
plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students  
she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida  
the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club  
as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything )  
critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout  
mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes "" one too many "" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing  
and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even "" explained "" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits    it 
really does clear up some stuff ! ! )  
other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her "" good girl stereotypical "" role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time  
denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits  
bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! )  
sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre  
on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible    "
1,"you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing  
the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care  
the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike  
the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom  
desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment )  
the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret  
only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time  
malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures  
he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process  
the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist  
 ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter  ) 
it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks  
cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler  
perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old  
that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar  
we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed  
both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest  
willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night  
osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do  
the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading "
1,"in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking  
the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone  
the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble  
all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element  
the duo must always be completely mismatched  
the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone  
however , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film  
rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 )  
proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before  
still , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview )  
this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west  
jackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him  
or , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes )  
despite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching  
jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches  
chris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character  
however , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films  
perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences  
when he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled  
still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu "
1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it

the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation  
yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory  
part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags  
slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going  
in "" les vacances de m  hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key  
in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat  
while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it  
when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues  
tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film  
it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and "" les vacances de m  hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well  
tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement  
when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark  
tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he's not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does  
for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one  
then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce "

what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america

unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada

1,"i was pleasantly surprised by this film  
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school  
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie  
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen  
titanic tells its story in two time periods  
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news  
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  
there she tells her story to lovett and his team  
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york  
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word  
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping  
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through  
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  
girls are going to swoon over him  
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing "
1,"the seasoned capt  dudley smith ( james cromwell ) questions his new protege , ed exley ( guy pearce ) about his political views when it comes to police work  
 "" would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty ? 
would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved ? "" 
exley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed 'no  ' 
stunned , smith pleads , "" then , for the love of god , don't be a detective  "" 
la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s  
organized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done  
there was "" hollywood "" jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito )  
sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn't afraid to flash his tinseltown style  
detective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice  
and then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive  
a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication  
almost immediately , an arrest is made  
but something doesn't seem quite right  
new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department  
suspicion and questions begin to mount  
odd alliances are created  
and as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment  
when the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn )  
all of the characters' levels of involvement are not immediately clear  
we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case "
1,"veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort  
when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs  
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake  
he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora )  
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session  
the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk  
eastwood furrows his brow  
as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent  
he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand  
but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? 
jeter doesn't know what he's talking about  
eastwood furrows his brow  
crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime  
the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs  
isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments  
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him  
denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife )  
but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera  
playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines  
when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive  
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes "

1,"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does  
far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 
thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception  
i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge  
unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight )  
off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney )  
while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup  "" 
he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 
as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human  "" 
the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable "
1,"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway  
in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where  
he's mean  
i mean really mean  
the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium  
every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress  
you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe  
one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks  
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too  
another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor  
aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target  
simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , also gay , does not fare much better  
when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces  
this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage  
an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him  
it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love  
one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others  
he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows  
good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt "
1,"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy )  
their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film  
the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax  
that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county  "" 
the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" )  
these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter  
if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug  
they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara )  
the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom  
unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money  
soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn  
meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family  
the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc  
the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully )  
the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact  
the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution  
there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech  
the coens take aim at just about every elite l  a  subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! "" 
shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on "

1,"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 
that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow  
she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder  
the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win  
jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history  
he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber  
his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980  
the background to the case is such  
during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke  
the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will  
when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood  
claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail  
he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him  
ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him  
we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out  
dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case  
nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him  
together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed  
silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film  
schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz  
there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical "
1,"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office  
a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs  
in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie  
in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types  
the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together  
jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts  
the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one  
chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time  
chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance  
he works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines  
almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent  
we're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd  
cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters  
the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help  
the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective  
it's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up  
rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank  
there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback  
also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing  
however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background "

many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles  
he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr  evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth  
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr  evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space  
dr  evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents

1,"on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director  
reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf  
here's what the two movies do have in common    
--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf 
reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three  
crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist  
the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated  
instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr  white ( keitel ) , mr  pink ( buscemi ) , mr  orange ( roth ) , mr  blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr  brown ( tarantino ) and mr  peach ( tarantino's chin )  
most of the movie's running time is spent with mr  white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive  
mr  orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound  
the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant "

1,"in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p  a , to report on groundhog day  
the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring  
phil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind  
however , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him  
groundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy  
the screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy  
although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film  
ramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well  
and the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita  
the performances are also excellent  
bill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style  
andie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film  
there is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part  
chris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall  
the supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist  
in fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase  
overall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all  
it almost seems perfect  
however , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over "
1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 "
1,"in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon  
in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it  
gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll  
mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt  
so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors  
but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy  
to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat  
his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back  
payback is often a very violent film  
to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films  
the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot  
when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot  
so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end  
it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities  
in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities  
but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him  
my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive  
gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job  
he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance  
this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) "
1,"well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise  
not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995  
once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer  
the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns  
it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent  
the plot in brief  
paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons  
his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans  
he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr  rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf  
he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires  
but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric  
i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging  
british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 )  
but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding  
the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character  
york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic  
this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him  
and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths  
the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original "
1,"i have to say it  
tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys  
ok , that's off my chest  
no more monkey puns , i promise  
seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business  
i know , i know , i promised  
and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie  
mark wahlberg stars as capt  leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future  
he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery  
despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious  
some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed  
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter  
the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says  
you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement  
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand  
lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human  "" 
anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue  
another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen  thade "
1,"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances  
for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women )  
despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences  
the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england  
as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback  
meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest  
lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology  
lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor  
lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself  
yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin  
and fate has decreed that they will one day meet  
that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help  
another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory  
at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other  
a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent  
but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her  
oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions  
on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route  
coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere  
the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments "
1,"one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise  
 "" spy kids "" certainly did  
an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun  
the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience  
the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving  
bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence  
what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics  
consider the other pg rated "" family friendly "" movie in theaters now  
 "" see spot run "" has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor  
body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop  
what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film  
the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process  
at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together  
of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells  
somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ? 
 "" spy kids "" is a welcome antidote to the repellent "" see spot run , "" using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness  
carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino )  
mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children  
what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies  
once agents from different countries assigned to "" erase "" each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family  
needless to say , they get drawn back to the business "
1,"capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing  
not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time  
extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum  
alas , the times are a-changin'  
in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts  
this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit  
oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released  
advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it  
the big hit is quite the opposite  
it was hyped as "" the new film from producer john woo "" , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action  
however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit  
the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver  
mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps  
sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it  
except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode  
the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff  
wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u  s  debut  
however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough "
1,"50's `aliens vs  
earth' idea revamped ! 
if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4  
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary  
id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993  
the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era  
the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked  
the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth  
the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities  
capt  hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc  
his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie  
id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses  
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? )  
no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious  
id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen  
if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens  
however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion  
an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous  
id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company  
some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi "
1,"i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars  
from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning  
from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece  
the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention  
miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film  
also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending  
mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games  
like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim  
because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film  
mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end  
the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious  
the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued  
after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening  
his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them  
the story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "" process "" that everyone is trying to get their hands on  
soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his "" process  "" 
through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross' boss mr  klein  
played by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role  
the most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott's joe ross "
1,"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i

to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples  
a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children

 "" you are a mother , "" her son marty tells her disgustedly  
 "" i know , but i still can't believe it  
i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? "" 
marty , you see , is a grown-up twin  
although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  
mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko  
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  
the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being  
mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  
she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb  
the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  
the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  
in this storm are two sane individuals  
the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication  
as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr  plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night

1,"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic  
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview  
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess     it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull  
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made  
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date  
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at  
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage  
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies  
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise  
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic  
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor  
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure  
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage  
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family  
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love  
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game "
1,"men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way  
although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type  
the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets  
director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece  
the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be  
the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist  
the mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe ""  
a though job , indeed  
the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states  
presumably , these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers  
that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them  
agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien  
when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them  
the device , described as "" out of state "" , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on

1," "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  
from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  
well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion  
instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  
and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments  
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  
when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene  
the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  
with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims  
the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work  
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier  
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  
with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  
duvall has every movement down pat  
even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  
he dances and claps all the way  
sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive  
 "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent "

king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi  
such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais  
beaumarchais was the author of the plays , "" the barber of seville "" and "" the marriage of figaro  "" 
today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once  
the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture  
one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year  
now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story  
the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais  
with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience  
his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning  
in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy  
as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship  
into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight  
beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided

audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney  
although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style

1,"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human  ' 
in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film  
does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? 
through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility  
expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria  
in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar  
deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip  
we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar  
what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse  
what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless  
to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos  
lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness  
the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions  
as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well  
the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality  
because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability  
as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob  
this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject  
while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large  
we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage  
with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching "
1,"corey yuen's latest film , "" hero "" is notable on two fronts  
first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production  
secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao  
the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai  
poverty and crime rule most of china  
a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier  
tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army  
wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation  
their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love  
wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction  
after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her  
first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous  
unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club  
the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn  
jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home  
see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder  
see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing  
unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung  
the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow  
the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's "" eastern condors "" , is a marvelous surprise "
1,"of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable  
think about it  
frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting  
if you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j  fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly  
movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt  
there's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something  
 ( and there's that michael j  fox thing again  ) 
but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about  
you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn )  
you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer )  
were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires  
any day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record  
or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade  
wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path  
in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses  
snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u  s  marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers "
1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours "
1,"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me  
because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  
as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something  
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  
for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  
or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  
again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  
i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking  
but he simply uses the best tool for the job  
it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward  
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet  
the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom  "" 
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story  
 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated  ) 
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items "
1,"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative  
written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement  
slow is the best description for the film at first  
it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family  
father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities  
they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder  
you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome  
but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident  
the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span  
though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving  
though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece  
one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable  
what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction  
the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss  
you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing  
you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation  
even better are the role reversals that take place within the household  
while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot  
not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them  
these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change "
1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds )  
after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is  
in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do  "" 
the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading  
it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but    "

1,"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman  
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips  
as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes  
instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city  
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity  
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment  
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds  
arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas  
his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives  
in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii )  
it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark  
arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body  
she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine  
veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process  
she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture  
arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation  
arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns  
joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house  
arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! 
he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations  
the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity "
1,"you've heard all the hype  
you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker  
if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy  
you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults  
believe the hype  
the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth  
but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy  
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well  
amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life )  
and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman  
however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost  
for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back "
1,"seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p  m  at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes )  
if there's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it  
and if there's ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , "" tomorrow never dies "" is it  
opening sequences almost always make or break action films  
when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come  
this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in  
first there's a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters  
there's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides  
when the scene ends in tragedy , it's clear there's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? 
the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon )  
as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero  
he single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! 
this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly  
it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape , instead , it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy  
it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term "" villain "" sounds passe )  
what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible  
jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons  
through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news  
not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality  
surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become "
1,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes  
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first  
 "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness  
hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer  
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen  
then comes the setup  
donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients  
to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines  
gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six  "" 
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n  m  , containing $2 million in cash  
there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead  
the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money  
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers  
decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby  
she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life  
thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature  
owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr  ) is currently the most hated man in america "
1,"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't  
the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film  
we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  
but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  
they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman  
the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her  
the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic  
in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america  
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich  
she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them  
oh yeah , and the ship sinks  
and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius  
the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak  
the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film  
without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  
firstly , there's cameron's direction  
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic  
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end  
there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron  
it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below "
1,"steve soderbergh's "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films  
made on a shoestring budget of $1  2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama  
the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's  
ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo )  
complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house  
ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex  
that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise  
director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's "" out of sight "" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's "" schizopolis "" )  
he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date  
the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character  
she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , "" short cuts "" )  
the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia  
the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets  
suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception  
the film has one fault , however  
the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable  
if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked  
 "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film  
soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this "
1,"damn those trailers  
had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand'  
as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair  
marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach  
she takes a nap while he goes for a swim  
when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found  
she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either  
did he disappear to start a new life ? 
was he killed by accident ? 
did he commit suicide ? 
marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers  
it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit  
the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing  
it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles  
this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling  
rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional  
the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking  
she can't quite get over him  
they've been married for twenty-five years  
the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too  
the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel  
likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience  
while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss "
1,"it has happened again  
a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed  
it is involving , suspenseful    
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain cole's trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone "
1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back "
1,"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs  miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 )  
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie  
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  
there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom  
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity  
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes  
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds  
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman )  
a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it  
whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been "" screwing around  "" 
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses  
he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together  
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers  
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that  
as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack  "" 
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency  
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr  ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) "
1,"i love this movie , and i've just seen for the umptenth time  
unfortunately , it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it  
it's my mission in life to spread the word : see this movie ! 
fred , george , doug and howie are reaching middleage  
three of them have a wife , kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay  
only fred is still a bachelor  
together they take the local train every morning to work in town  
on one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar , fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress  
he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night  
since they always split everything four ways , they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well , kathy  
however , kathy isn't completly honest to them  
in fact , she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male  
with these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper  
ok , have one thing clear though  
the romantic rendezvous' between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent  
the script stays above the waist - or to be precise , above the neck  
noboyd claims that kathy is their mistress , the four guys call her their 'companion'  
the censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years , but that only shows how long ago 1962 was  
small children could watch this without being corrupted  
kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie , even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student  
james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies "
1,"i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie  
i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night  
it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether )  
i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now  
and i love gillian anderson  
the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off  
the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying  
this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment )  
i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met  
actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right  
when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work  
the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building  
but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself  
the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien  
the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer  
it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi  
soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens  
as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise  
fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film  
director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television "
1,"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys  
one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker  
woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy  
woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him  
buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend  
meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped  
al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll  
now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan  
the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody  
if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever  
trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered  
while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy  
the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i  e  , al's apartment building )  
the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear  
while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else  
buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  
in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life "
1,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is  
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act  
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic )  
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky  
she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try  
they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming

the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as "" i'll be right back , "" or simply with the overall tone of the scene  
how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change ? 
that's the kind of bursting originality that allows "" final destination "" to invade the viewer's mind , even days after seeing it , making one pause before ever entering a dark room , taking a shower , or even going to sleep  
the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's "" scream  "" 
 "" final destination , "" directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick , glen morgan , and james wong , the latter two being writers for the t  v  
series "" the x-files , "" is a movie with wonderful ideas , and executes them effortlessly  
it's rare a film of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days , as the genre has seem to be completely worn out ? ? `but "" final destination "" has more in store for one than one can imagine  
unlike "" halloween "" 's michael myers or "" nightmare on elm street "" 's freddy kruger , "" final destination "" 's killer is of the supernatural , the dark one himself , death  
the intriguing premise is as follows ; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip  
after boarding the plane , one of the students , alex browning ( devon sawa ) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff , killing everyone on board  
once waking up , alex gets himself and six others off of that plane , all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening  
shortly after their departure , the plane takes off , and guess what ; it blows up in middair  
now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms  valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them  
the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane ? ? `but who is next , and how will death get them ? 
 "" final destination "" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful ; always making the viewer frantic , as death will strike in the most unlikely of times  
john denver's "" rocky mountain high "" being played pretty much warrants another death ? ? `everyone on that plane learned the hard way  
although it's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you don't know when death is coming  
like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during "" final destination "" "
1,"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways  
in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others  
this movie closely resembles a james bond flick  
it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal  
kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations  
the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests  
as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork  
that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint  
he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be  
this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life  
kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija  
during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles  
once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid  
when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire  
dr  emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion

this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal

film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film    
funny and pointed in its own way  
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you     
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through  
having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers  
and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer  
goro has a supermarket  
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket  
bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can  
goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else  
hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market  
and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves  
hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all  
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference  
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store "
1,"it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system  
no major surprise , when j  s  mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either  
the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority  
small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on  
there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting "" americanised "" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition  
the people vs  larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex  
does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? 
larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u  s  congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net  
but even with such actions , americans remain undecided  
the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire  
what they have ignored is actually a great picture  
woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers  
and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly  
the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself  
edward norton plays their jerky lawyer  
the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids "

everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images  
a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it  
another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye  
when one fellow quietly stated "" i've never really been a fan of musicals , "" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical  
there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it  
 "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience  
australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind "" strictly ballroom "" and "" romeo + juliet , "" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from "" the sound of music "" to "" smells like teen spirit  "" 
sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , "" moulin rogue "" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the "" random "" setting  
oh , and it has a story as well  
 "" it was 1899 , the summer of love    
 "" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , "" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , "" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo )  
christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor  
at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying  
christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession  
working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named "" spectacular spectacular  "" 
zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine

1,"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well  
taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us  
but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted  
so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment  
like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man  
the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different  
al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle  
and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie  
will is a troubled individual  
as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse  
an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis  
now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet  
he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box  
but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems  
while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards  
then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work  
will flees , but lambeau tracks him down  
unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer  
the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist  
eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case "

martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt  
when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st  petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate  
with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods  
smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin  
in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter  
he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can  
soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce  
when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st  petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana  
this time , onegin finds her irresistable  
what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch  
overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past  
the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like "" onegin ""  
petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "" parking lot "" : "" you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone  "" 
onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well  
what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go  
out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard "

i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response  
an all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis  
the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great "" conjunction "" of three suns  
along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig  
much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design  
the puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue  
the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect  
as well , trevor jones' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character  
i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn't be helped , but i wish the film was longer  
jen and kira have wonderful    well , 
chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated  
the dark crystal has a very small cult following  
the weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting  
a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal  
that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of "" the muppet show "" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien's fan-base  
 ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public "
1,"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources  
every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers  
in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him  
in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors  
jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking  
he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line  
watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages  
but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him  
almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills  
this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence  
this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain  
 ( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible  ) 
heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist  
in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu  
jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness )  
he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms  
the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil  
en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives  
once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off  
this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions "
1,"contact is a film that tries to do several different things  
it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr  ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey )  
the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals  
the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files  
the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else  
they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person  
the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey  
most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens  
scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between  
the debate is fueled largely by dr  arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species  
the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed  
still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society  
the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists  
palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology  
then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions  
contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself  
the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss  
for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction "
1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you "
1,"it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time  
based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue  
however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction  
frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks )  
through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law  
from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners  
the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them  
the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb  
the ensemble acting in the film is perfect  
hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles  
they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles  
they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience  
the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting  
some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan  
hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie  
every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying  
it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks  
rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection  
as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others  
this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable "

chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business  
chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder  
howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent  
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge  
there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her  
the reason ? 
both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex  
 "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says  
howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan  
they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp  
chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner

1,"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage  
 ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan  ) 
in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china  
a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle  
mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father  
ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph  
the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes  
mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman  
the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy )  
in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army  
old mr  fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen )  
fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead  
meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner  
 ( his only duty is to ring a gong  ) 
mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero  
with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? 
opinion : east meets west  
i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors  
from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan  
i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? 
yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic "
1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching "
1,"there's a moment in schindler's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground  
one girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes  
it is probably the finest moment through out the film  
when i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not say why  
this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole  
when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red  
at another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied  
like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul  
but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing  
starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings  
the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade  
steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e  t  
-- but it wasn't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be  
the product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you  
throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads  
we watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment  
the film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment and you'll be bitterly dissapointed  
it does reward the patient viewer  
this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece "
1,"ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition 
synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? 
believe it  
sliding doors is a love 'what if' story  
the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions  
in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job  
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch )  
helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future  
the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories  
in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train  
arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn )  
this leads to a life where helen moves out  
helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business  
in story two , helen experiences a different fate  
she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity  
in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry  
will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? 
opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks  
at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking  
sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year  
not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance  
when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! 
nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes  
nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "" 
when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache "
1,"apocalypse now , based on the novel "" hearts of darkness "" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle  
a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film  
in many ways , this debate could go either way  
apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made  
in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years  
apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l  willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e  kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia  
captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with "" extreme prejudice "" because he has been deemed a murderer  
willard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation  
accusing someone of murder in this situation is like "" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 "" , as he puts it  
it doesn't make too much sense  
escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat  
the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr  clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne )  
willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big  
the men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations  
but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore  
kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf

1,"since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller "" blood simple , "" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood  
their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances  
in "" the big lebowski , "" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning "" fargo , "" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude  
the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high  
the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties  
he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks  
he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in  
one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money  
the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here  
suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money  
by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in "" fargo  "" 
 "" the big lebowski "" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts  
it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies  
 "" lebowski "" has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made "" raising arizona "" such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of "" barton fink "" ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded "" the hudsucker proxy  "" 
the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , "" barton fink , "" "" the hudsucker proxy , "" and "" fargo  "" 
deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view  
if "" fargo "" was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , "" the big lebowski "" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking  
it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end  
the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism  
with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out "
1,"john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad  
it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying  
james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie  
the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence  
the bad : no scares  
yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all  
james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight  
daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny  
in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy  
of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death  
after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it  
they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive  
sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire  
she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek  
they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects  
'vampires' definately could have been done better  
the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had  
it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy  
john carpenter does a great job of directing this film  
he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable "
1,"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x  i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  
i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  
as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton  
it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star  
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year  
he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien )  
the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car  
we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny  
in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother  
much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy  
when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things  
what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms  
it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material  
because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic  
i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart  
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men  
it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up  
of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part  
it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest "
1,"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon  
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer  
simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them  
simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart  
surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle  
simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what  
joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is  
simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't "" natural ""  
even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a "" normal "" son  
he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev  russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks  
the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother  
it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie  
joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is  
with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way  
most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is  
simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way  
starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey  
jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right  
this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job "
1,"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more  
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater  
so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes  
although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie  
quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen  
the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema  
not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough  
kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture  
it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville  "" 
maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times  
it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like  
soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness  
at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr  johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j  t  
walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town  
fine performances are turned in all around  
maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j  t  
walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) "
1,"the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug  26th/1998 ) 
starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert 
in "" the heartbreak kid "" , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time  
he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another  
i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film  
as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon  
halfway there , he begins to resent his bride  
by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife  
as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him  
the phrase "" the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence "" was practically written with him in mind  
however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes  
the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest  
the end of "" the heartbreak kid "" is both hilarious and sad for that very reason  
charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire  
however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride  
she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do  
 "" the heartbreak kid "" was written by neil simon and it shows  
simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here  
as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows  
the character of george costanza on "" seinfeld "" seems to have been modelled after him  
the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy "
1,"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today  
1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year  
we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them  
this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films  
critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment  
but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie  
the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend  
her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted  
after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck  
of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her  
however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money  
she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years  
while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there  
she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again  
which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it  
after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones  
he is a man who has had his share of bad things  
while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not  
whatever happens the film was excellent to me  
i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great "
1,"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  
i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs  
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island  
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w  
earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks  
it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital  
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day  
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love  
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  
there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them  
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work  
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  
one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment "
1,"disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched  
to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise  
unfortunately , folks , it's not likely  
dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent  
to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising  
so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all  
it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch  
in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? )  
pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future  
due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows  
brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day  
  
  
or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton )  
naturally the two will become infatuated with one another  
 ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) 
there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings  
and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic  
  
  
but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! 
if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself "
1,"let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was "" goldeneye "" was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , "" a view to a kill "" or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing  
but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie  
the new "" m "" is a woman )  
 "" tomorrow never dies "" is the picture "" goldeneye "" should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since "" the spy who loved me ""  
the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine  
as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media  
carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from "" dr  
strangelove "" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days )  
it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women  
enter michelle yeoh , fresh from "" supercop "" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero  
they make a great team  
 "" tomorrow never dies "" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of "" turner & hooch ""  
spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in "" goldeneye ""  
moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language  
returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's "" remington steele "" , as has his deadpan wit  
and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that "" genius is insanity with some success "" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain  
in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures  
there a few too many explosions in "" tomorrow never dies "" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue  
and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here  
as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed "
1,"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility  
considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally , we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film  
but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? 
the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ? 
yes  
does it matter ? 
not really  
the film opens in october of 1969  
firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson )  
the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it  
when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other  
sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time "
1,"i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume  
i was dead wrong about all of those things  
the emperor's new groove is funny  
damn funny

the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing  
the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over

the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia

when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her "" assistant "" kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama  
kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him  
then the fun starts  
for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination  
yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl  
the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense )  
david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film  
spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times  
needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days "

1,"as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? 
also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films  
this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school  
intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei  
meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail  
in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings  
in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls  
neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival  
suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them  
an opening prologue in shall we dance ? 
goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety  
it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle  
the dance school in shall we dance ? 
plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities  
most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr  aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba  
sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps  
it's a delicate performance with a huge heart  
shall we dance ? 
is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit  
suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution  
it is here that shall we dance ? 
feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis  
suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together  
that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? 
conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt "

bruce willis portrays his character perfectly , balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully  
haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole , showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off  
toni collette , looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel's wedding , gives a strong performance as cole's mother , who is trying to cope with both her son's "" illness "" and the passing of her mother  
finally , olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who's not around and flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end  
it's a shame that they show cole's abilities in the trailer , because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same , so we already know what's going on before most of the rest of the cast does  
in retrospect though , the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end of the film , so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film  
i'm glad that the run of teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare  
films like this , the similarly themed stir of echoes , and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999 "
1,"everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene  
everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over  
and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance  
good ! 
that's what you're supposed to do ! 
oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning  
deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 )  
major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry  
when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences  
it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating )  
but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e  g  
pulp fiction )  
pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny  
but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter  
the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory  
the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others  
joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox )  
the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip  
they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40  00 for the task  
drew also has the famous "" dueling banjos "" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged "
1,"capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be  
makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence  
 "" serial killer chic "" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones  
i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry  
i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero  
thankfully , that's not the way henry works  
the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work  
it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him  
at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago  
in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers  
they are damned together from that moment on  
henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun  
the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv  
the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron  
no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker  
in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment  
the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation  
henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting  
michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well  
the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release "
1," "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  
the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy )  
unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in  
veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider  
after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  
however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife  
she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied  
at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself  
once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well  
she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco  
their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances "
1,"like the wonderful 1990 drama , "" awakenings , "" starring robin williams and robert de niro , "" at first sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks  
since "" awakenings "" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , "" at first sight "" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama  
the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country  
at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind  
amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love  
once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history  
at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis )  
ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects  
he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship  
on the basis of the overall story , "" at first sight "" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , "" awakenings  "" 
what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance  
however , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy  
usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you've got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight  
the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil  
the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two  
these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the "" big city  "" 
the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board  
val kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears  
it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off  
mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here "
1,"aliens ! ! well , that is what this movie is about  
computer generated aliens  
ok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens  
it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib  
if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known  
the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits  
since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be  
well , in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft , squishy and cuddly kind  
just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark  
along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way  
j , well soon to be j , a smart ass cop ( played by will smith ) runs down what he thinks is a would-be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular  
k aims to recruit our poor j , but that is not the whole point of this movie  
the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge  
that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy  
some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty  
color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch  
the dialogue is witty to say the least  
this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie  
tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully  
the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them "
1,"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p  m  at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless )  
that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  
i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  
the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come  
we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  
she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  
maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed  
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  
this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  
nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle "
1,"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general  
words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations  
the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context  
in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise  
same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime  
the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe  
his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro  
shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away  
after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely )  
upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba  
shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war  
thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary  
it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books  
those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre  
this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires  
unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work  
the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda  
christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role  
his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate  
his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends "
1,"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment  
as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers  
three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money  
jacob and lou want to pocket the cash  
hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find  
eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways  
things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan  
disaster is sure to strike  
director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name  
while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come  
scott b  smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension  
while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter  
alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character  
danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score  
if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long  
just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further  
while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand )  
the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife  
this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films "
1,"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone  
to be specific , let me give you an example  
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? 
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled  
on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at  
our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles  
luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big  
the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler )  
one particularly striking m  o  
on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims  
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests  
she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service  
no points for guessing what they do  
her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job  
there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say  
gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see  
unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there   
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival  
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film "
1,"it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts  
but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut  
uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid  
but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious  
the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns  
george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks  
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station  
george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like "" wheel of fish "" and movies like "" conan , the librarian  "" 
as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate  
as r  j  
fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls  
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters  
the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed  
like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss  
for every gag that works , at least one fizzles  
for instance , weird al's mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation )  
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way  
in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since  "
1,"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell )  
when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine  "" 
i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea  
it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale  
the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it  
we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk  
he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this  
somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him  
it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade  
i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit  
however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer  
the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to  
the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original  
most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable  
thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development  
much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie  
pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would  
he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be  
we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him  
newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run "
1,"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies  
i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven  
was it any good ? 
well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! )  
now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  
i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection  
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail  
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7  50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  
yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from  
as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  
as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring  
now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 
ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain  
throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  
how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved  
the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  
since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't  
 ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves )  
like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have "

with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible  
some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline  
and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right  
oh , and it's rated g  
incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century  
he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note  
 "" did you do it ? "" he asks his boy  
 "" no father , i didn't , "" ronnie answers  
that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court  
they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task  
it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century  
but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that  
soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings  
so do we  
all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent  
the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense  
but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were  
nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless  
his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game "
1,"robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good  
it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script  
as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs  
first we meet willie ( charles s  dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit  
we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband  
we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore )  
then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live  
we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop  
we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion  
we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband  
she exclaims "" here i come ! "" 
and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself  
soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out  
convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder  
she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard  
the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma )  
meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success  
so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo , "" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade  
robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town  
indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional "
1,"perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects  
there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise  
whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology  
the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story  
unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event  
it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length  
contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound  
in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp  
with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented  
the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach  
but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent  
the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner  
and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story  
as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind  
billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy  
only a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  
morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth  
the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion  
the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy  
the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles "
1,"i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius  
when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure  
and when it doesn't work , it's just dull  
i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! 
is brilliant  
mars attacks ! 
is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas  
but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! 
has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it  
the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! 
portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are  
the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation  
the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping  
it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing  
the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes  
we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming  
but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton  
it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars  
anyone who comes to mars attacks ! 
expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses  
jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer  rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr  strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's "" kennedy room , "" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy  
sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j  fox is her newsman husband "
1,"wow ! what a movie  
it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original  
yep that pretty much describes this movie  
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen  
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often  
besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever  
period  
then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite  
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job  
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of  
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building    you 
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8  
he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer  
in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden  
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind  
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike  
he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind  
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all "
1,"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling  
mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example  
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 
the plot is deceptively simple  
george washington carver high school is having student elections  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high  
mr  "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run  
and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons  
the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be  
you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have  
_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype  
what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier  
the similarities are staggering : 
tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive  
max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive  
the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined

1,"with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting  
the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both  
at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role  
but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works  
it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout  
reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with "" trinity "" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as "" morpheus "" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell  
neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems  
moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it  
neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually "" the one "" prophesized to come and save the world  
reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights  
the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality  
how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? 
and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? 
unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks  
perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix  
weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix  
like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny  
weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence  
the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography  
it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors  
in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny  
just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring "

1,"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven  
that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
 "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality  
of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart  
carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not  
carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding  
being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite )  
he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison  
she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down )  
all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it "

1,"jamaica is a hot vacation spot  
the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity  
and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation  
life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country  
while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface  
the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid  
it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants  
instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , "" you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet  "" 
this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there  
this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film  
stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals  
this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life  
people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country  
the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not  
of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank  
officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word  
the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u  s  is forcing on the citizens  
admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument "
1,"when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times  
such was the case with frequency  
every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview

it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous  
it looked like a flop  
well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far

an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years  
john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes

including john's mother  
this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen )

also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending

co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done "

1,"you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade  
two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities  
nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence  
ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple  
ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble )  
their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots  
for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn  
yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan  
and the two are kept busy  
one , the other or both are in nearly every scene  
hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh  
ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew  
their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle  
and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe  
the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here  
true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor  
the ephrons' script is witty and sharp  
however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven  
some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy  
also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story "
1,"this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree  
although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers  
it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one  
`a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why  
ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable  
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well  
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : 
1 ) period detail  
this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail  
shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head  
shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing  
on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration  
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality  
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like  
2 ) mom and dad  
both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles  
it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured  
for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues  
in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord  
his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment  
which brings us to "
1,"i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger  
i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought  
the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public  
since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla  , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign  
all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras  
people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions  
revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones  
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else  
even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes  
if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news  
either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks  
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial "" eat me "" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney )  
but weird things start happening  
a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father  
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm  
the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island  
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him  
as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else  
there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence "
1,"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , 
it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement  
with this and "" crimson tide , "" he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart  
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant  
 "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical  
it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be  
it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person  
i hate to do this , but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened  
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year  
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't  
will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect  
he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless  
he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one  
so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring    except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering "" id4 "" / "" men in black "" territory  
he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of "" six degrees of separation "" for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities  
smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee )  
the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it  
as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet "
1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list "
1,"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker  
screenplay by andrew kevin walker  
inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving  
directed by tim burton  
starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien  
special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken  
synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation  
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them  
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery  
comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years  
batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels  
he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! )  
sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies  
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe  
christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders  
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s  
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein  
i mention these allusions for a reason  
seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film  
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this "
1,"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up  
the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood  
hrundi v  bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india  
hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job  
on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse  
during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can  
this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set  
many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever  
and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr  clutterbuck ( j  
edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi  
clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood  
but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur  
of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble  
each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous  
and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way  
the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations  
it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? )  
if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party "
1,"one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting  
the main story is about dr  james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr  ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone  
they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey  
carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there  
when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life  
screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients  
dr  nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing  
however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug  
the performances are all very commendable  
sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role  
kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital  
joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey  
charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr  stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch  
some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters  
as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part  
other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks "
1,"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast  
sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules  
but nothing entirely groundbreaking  
with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques  
it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be  
the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa  
but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib  
found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own  
we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight )  
of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero  
in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously  
gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here  
most of the characters are amusing without being forced  
as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture  
here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle  
of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie  
the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation  
directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel  
as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave  
your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment "
1,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again  
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10  
this one , however , is shockingly not bad  
in fact , it's actually good  
not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  
because it's cute and innocent fun  
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  
because the lead star is immensely appealing  
because the parents are also immensely appealing  
and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun  
there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third  
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week  
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" )  
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing  
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap  "" 
it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version  
it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it "
1," "" being john malkovich "" is the type of film we need to see more  
today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes  
malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur  
this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable  
john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time  
his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment  
when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk  
when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor  
it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time  
meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her  
the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever  
the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream  
being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies  
i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery  
in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant  
it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you  
it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue  
even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing  
it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion  
it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed "

1,"for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor  
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? 
harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? 
with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster  
it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity  
for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood  
the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis )  
but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life  
the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair  
what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen  
shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives  
emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player  
patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car  
and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer  
pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it  
 "" why do we put up with it ? "" 
emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch  
 "" we try to talk about it , and look what happens  
we fight for 20 minutes  "" 
there's the admirable crux of this picture  
girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action  
but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take  
the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) "
1,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller  
in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isn't even fiction  
it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image  
in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies "

-1,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  
everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through  
 "" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day  
inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper  
soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message  
of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner  
she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier  
do you think you know where this is headed ? 
most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second  
if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city  
meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently  
it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea  
the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune  
the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining  
usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking  "" 
when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble  
i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks )  
always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing  
nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after  
this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels  "" 
although theresa is deeply touched by the "" heartfelt "" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began "
-1,"that's exactly how long the movie felt to me  
there weren't even nine laughs in nine months  
it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr  hugh grant , a huge dork  
it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant is annoying  
not just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying  
since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? 
but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has "" a big pussy , "" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? 
nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot  
hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist  
why a child psychologist ? 
so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : 
kid : my dad's an asshole  
grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? 
kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole  
more like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief  
so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles )  
this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant  
the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed "" arnie the dinosaur "" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store  
the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment  
not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor  
his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ?

-1," * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once  
when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically  
such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button  
this fear of drama soured me on fast times    , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms  heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu  
has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ? 
attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger  
the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes  
they become walking wardrobes  
small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder  
he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam  
though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her  
 ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged  
dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions  
unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated  ) 
when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear )  
although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott  
she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend "

-1,"there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it  
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes  
writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category  
weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories  
hitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked  
an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops , ( jeff daniels ) and wes ( eric stoltz )  
a murder is not vice territory , flirting with asian prostitues is , but wes would rather play inquisitive detective  
meanwhile , washed-up director , teddy ( paul mazursky ) is about to end his life  
but before he can do that , he must find a good home for his dog  
enter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) , who takes the dog and teddy for a ride  
stuffy art dealer , allan hopper ( greg cruttwell ) has kidney stones  
while struggling about his fancy house , he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's ( glenne headly ) plain appearance  
don't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on  
you might like that feeling of cluelessness  
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes  
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though  
the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny  
funny , that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of tarantino's pulp chcaracters  
the tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ? 
guy who also did last seduction ) red rock west  
two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters "
-1,"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? 
 "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter  
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable  
it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim  
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings  
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating  "" 
with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped  
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro )  
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization  
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom  
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing )  
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help  
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back  
the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right  
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all  
mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple  
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie  
everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism  
nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations  
every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about "

-1,"alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure "" the musketeer  "" 
for some reason that i may figure out later , i don't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of "" the musketeer  "" 
it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film's xin-xin xiong ( "" once upon a time in china "" ) and yuen woo-ping from "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon  "" 
the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well  
elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano  
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd  
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters  
the real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari )  
chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma  
suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen  
if "" the musketeer "" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons  
stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one  
the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive  
catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in "" the princess bride )  
stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character  
tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre  
he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout  
the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed  
peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well  
a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps "
-1,"this is the movie that could single-handedly bring "" mystery science theater 3000 "" out of cancellation  
it's one of those movies that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious , due in no small part to its big star , supermodel cindy crawford  
if you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues  
if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l  a  , you'll change your mind when you see fair game  
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition  
in a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course )  
we all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day  
nonetheless , someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer , but we're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes  
and for you horny teenage boys out there , you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark    
come to think of it , that may have been a body double  
cindy crawford isn't black , is she ? 
like i said , crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her  
billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ? 
alec ? 
adam ? 
kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion

it's every cop show of the 70's mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90's

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health "
-1,"this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while  
with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors  
his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws  
obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake  
but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors  
it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories )  
casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school  
no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first  
while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic  
all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore )  
as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours  
half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in "" beverly hills "" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images  
the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects  
there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around  
i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ? 
there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended  
this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality  
but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind  
the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth  
johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents  
but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose "
-1,"overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson  
he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it  
he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience  
i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? 
the original was a great psychological horror film  
this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary  
in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary  
unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles  
i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed  
it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly  
owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability  
catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs  
liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do  
finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her  
apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed  
that's too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative  
this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first )  
when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? 
robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that  
one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset  
if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying  
what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything "
-1,"i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday'  
it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football  
unfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers  
in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics  
we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook  
it grows tiresome and monotonous  
yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma  
matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go  
tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut  
aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad  
when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game  
once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field  
nerves , you see  
eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc  - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like  
and i believe it  
there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball  
the problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate  
football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush  
i guess he is mistaken "

the cartoon figure mr  magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images  
if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection  
for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan

like home alone 3 but without any class , mr  
magoo can only be described as painfully bad  
fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity

-1,"upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases "" been there "" and "" done that "" come quickly to mind  
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series  
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff  
what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka  
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith  
along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act  
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical  
spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films  
the "" dick , the world is in danger  
what is it ? 
well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun   
 ( i'm paraphrasing ) "" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny  
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue  
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short  
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax

 "" final fantasy "" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed  
if you're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials  
with an expression-challenged cast , "" final fantasy "" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit  
the result is ugly , confusing and boring

if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it  
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls  
most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities  
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr "
-1,"one of the 90s' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it's the "" ___ from hell "" movie ! 
starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! 
there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell  
but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! ! 
the mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange  
she has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan  
her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan  
but those intentions are about to change  
you see , martha lives by manipulation  
she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses  
now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson  
though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha's web of deception  
it's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha' schemes  
as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted  
but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots  
it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye  
then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's likely to question details  
jessica lange's martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can  
a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy  
gwyneth paltrow doesn't have much to build upon , as helen's only character trait seems to be "" daughter-in-law ""  
still , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he's inexplicably missing for much of the film  
still , there have been much worse "" ____ from hell "" films  
even with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion "
-1,"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff  
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper  
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood  
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence  
continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need  
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? )  
oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities  
a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e  g  
marshall )  
while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault  
there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow  
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men  
the man ? 
he is the president of the united states of america  
where does the film go wrong ? 
it cannot be the acting  
clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances  
the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre "
-1,"fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls  
being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story  
fair enough  
i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 "" this is a no-no "" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on "" it won't hurt ! "" 
for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes  
this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism  
they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics )  
rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate  
life is pain , highness  
get used to it  
she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest  
for children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated  
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap  
these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet )  
of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors  
i don't care  
gender be damned , she's borderline inept  
braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people  
don't be fooled  
this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed  
the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence "
-1,"the first in a very long list of things wrong with "" i still know what you did last summer "" is the title  
think about it for a second  
if the last movie was called "" i know what you did last summer "" , wouldn't the next movie have to be "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" ? 
if anyone working on this movie had an i  q  
greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , "" hey    
wait a minute ""  
but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that  
what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick  
i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the "" kind of "" )  
it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did  
there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start  
first of all , i guess , is the setting  
the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting  
exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? 
the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through  
in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries  
when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue  
now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ? 
in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , "" just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time  "" 
oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway "
-1,"mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect  
a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  
however , mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  
jackie chan plays , who else , jackie  
this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  
there are only two scenes of him cooking  
for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop  
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 
a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons  
although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles    hmmm , 
shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 
anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape  
here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 
oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  
as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape "
-1,"guilt  guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living  
but i know so well that it's a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt  
verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies  
the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year  
a simple , white on black title card reads "" starship troopers "" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits  
is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? 
were the rest of the film that subdued    
starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names  
they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet  
the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue  
 ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future  ) 
one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future  
hysterically funny , actually  
but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between  
the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least  
the politics of the film are scary  
the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos  
there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it "
-1,"it's time to take cover  
after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath "
-1,"nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy  
however half baked doesn't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more  
the plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners  
there's the group's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams )  
kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse  
when the animal keels over , he finds himself accused of killing a police officer , and facing a $1 , 000 , 000 bail  
his friends promise to raise money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how  
that is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor  
soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii )  
for a comedy , the film is pretty humorless  
not that it doesn't try    it's 
just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat  
the four leads are nearly all playing the same character  
only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another )  
to help out , the film is packed full of cameos  
steven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another  
none of them work , beyond the simple "" hey , that's _____ "" level  
in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle "
-1," "" virus "" is a monster movie without a monster  
any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise  
sadly , "" virus "" does not deliver , on any level  
the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it  
sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat  
cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures  
see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money  
at least , i * think * that's what they do  
along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained  
so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters  
the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg  
yes , borg  
complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye  
apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical  
so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for "" spare parts ""  
blah , blah , blah  
i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't  
suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! )  
everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies  
for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , "" tetsuo-the iron man "" "
-1,"once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero  
the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability  
some of these excursions were fun  
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action  
and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? 
i'll explain  
knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong  
marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider )  
they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business  
i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one  
i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow  
tommy is really working with the cia  
his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons  
he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys  
if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off  
if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea  
knock off sucks  
it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares  
it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star  
the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe  
director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot "

susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings  
brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious "" surprise endings  "" 
comments : thanksgiving  
for most , it's a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good , home-cooked meal  
for the makers of body count , however , thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders , violence , profanity , family dysfunction , and sex  
boy , do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap  
alyssa milano , the former child star of who's the boss ? , matures to made-for-video sludge like this movie  
someone somewhere thought it'd be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice-t , who has since guest-starred in the made-for-the-sci-fi-channel series welcome to paradox  
this isn't exactly a winning combination  
outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me , what else may be said for this turkey ? 
well , it teaches us that beautiful , attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers  
it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic , stuck-up rich white people waited on by black servants  
it shows us that old guys , try not to laugh , sit around and talk about "" the appeal of postmodernism "" during their free time  
and , it proves that you can have sex in your parents' basement when they have a dozen or so guests over , and no one will notice  
before i go any further , if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked , forget it  
the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don't see any of milano's attributes  
they do , however , inexplicably throw in a scene where ice-t whistles "" jingle bells "" after killing people , for whatever that's worth  
this film was originally titled below utopia  
perhaps they should have renamed it hell  
avoid this clunker "
-1,"1989's "" major league "" was a delightful surprise  
i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny  
however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale  
that's certainly true of "" major league ii "" and the most recent entry , "" major league : back to the minors  "" 
the title is , of course , a contradiction  
shouldn't it be "" minor league ? "" 
that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie  
original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for "" major league ii "" ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie  
the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in "" league ii "" ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise  
the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf  
the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins' aaa team , the buzz  
you can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win  
there's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie )  
along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films )  
sum total : none  
the entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors  
gus' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley )  
leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves  
 ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner )  
gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs  the twins "

there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide  
richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen )  
once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise  
this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel  
the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking  
i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning  
but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography  
though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking  
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts  
this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better  
now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise  
this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable  
there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples )  
i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me  
the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child  
although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher  
the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does  
the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough  
richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line "

the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery  
critique : this movie did not make me laugh once  
perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it  
perhaps  
perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld  
perhaps  
perhaps it was because the movie just wasn't funny  
absolutely  
the lack of humour wasn't the only issue that i had with this film either  
the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility  
they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake  
the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem didn't lie in the acting  
i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time , but i can't  
unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house  
overall , this movie stinks  
on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes  
on the bad side , this movie is not funny , interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible  
a person wouldn't even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness "
-1,"when considering david fincher's latest film , "" the game "" , four words come to mind  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isn't simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn )  
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
 "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it  
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening  
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven  
the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall  "" 
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation  
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience "

jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating  
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami  
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters  
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film  
there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension  
in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid  
that is not the case here  
the script suffers from random plot developments  
there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" 
at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along  
we've never seen her mother before  
we never see her again  
who cares ? 
what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy "
-1,"what hath kevin williamson wrought ? 
while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films  
those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_  
add to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy  
the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas  
first , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling  
this sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer's look  
dressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know    _fisherman , 
sans the hook  
one thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise  
students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of "" mythology "" passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness  
it hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn't )  
michelle , slain by the "" killer lurking in the backseat "" of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well  
the setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares  
too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door  
but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there's also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre  
banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor  
some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so  
the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent "
-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature

-1,"despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances  
so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is  
it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse  
something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own )  
the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw )  
this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find  
meanwhile , scientist dr  laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes  
it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive  
it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does  
 "" this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! "" 
exclaims one character in the early going  
in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong  
the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected  
looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's "" black cancer "" to me  
but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from  
species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did  
human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h  r  giger )

-1,"ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls  
yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual "" identities , "" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "" girl power  "" 
but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world  
the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- "" scary "" ( melanie brown ) , "" baby "" ( emma bunton ) , "" sporty "" ( melanie chisolm ) , "" ginger "" ( geri halliwell ) , and "" posh "" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad "" too much "" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film )  
a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e  grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant "" mate "" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien )  
capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit "" say you'll be there , "" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? 
wrong  it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches  
i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the "" wacky "" goings-on  
spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride  
while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a "" dance bootcamp "" scene , the girls sing the lyric "" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra "" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level  
some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford  
the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond  
ha ha  
as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves  
the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world  
posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film  
baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out  
there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being "" ginger "" or "" scary "" ? 
apparently , just their wardrobes  
spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , "" wannabe "
-1,"8mm is not going to enlighten your day  
it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence  
not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well  
nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late  
he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality  
cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability  
at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of  
his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe  
the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered  
or so it seems  
welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth  
and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head  
he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography  
max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change  
the devil changes you  ' 
these turn out to be very wise words  
8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution  
the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her

-1,"man , this was one wierd movie  
similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is  
the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship

this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - "" screw it , let's just kill everybody ""  
from then on - forget sci-fi    this 
movie becomes 100% horror  
what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way  
instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore      yawn     everyone's 
seen it all before and knows when to expect it

-1," "" spice world "" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls  
sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while  
actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls  
but overall , who cares ? 
not me  
if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood  
in "" spice world "" they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews  
amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money  
and they keep babbling about "" girl power "" when they should really be talking about "" cleavage power ""  
i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? 
the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film  
by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says "" based on an idea by the spice girls ""  
wow , they got idea credit ! 
i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood    
giving credit for simply having the thought "" say girls , let's make a movie ! "" 
the supporting cast fares well  
roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing "" chief "" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch  
mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e  grant )  
one question though : george wendt ? 
you'd think that "" spice world "" would envoke one of two reactions in people  
if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards  
and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then "" spice world "" will really make you sick "

-1,"i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been  
mind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way  
i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream's  
as a result , it's even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it's about thirty times smarter than it is  
based on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top  
the appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90's ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town  
from there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male "" hero , "" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five's jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr  , respectively ) cheer her on  
after getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night  
his face is mangled so they can't tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world  
cut to one year later  
the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad  
main brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college  
blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town  
brunette male is a fisherman , living off the land  
blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team  
then , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them  
it all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie  
all the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation

now , sadly , he's added "" eyes wide shut "" to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook  
kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead  
this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut  
kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler's 1926 novella "" dream story , "" has confused eroticism with nudity  
he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly  
he has confused profundity with pretentiousness  
in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out  
pollack , the director of such box-office hits as "" tootsie "" and "" out of africa , "" is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth    
and there isn't much depth to begin with ! 
unhappily , there's not likely to be a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one  
in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film

these are the first words that came to mind after it was over  
when a movie is called _vampires_ , "" not scary "" aren't words that should be associated with it  
but that wasn't my only gripe  
john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_  
unfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach  
with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan  
the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people  
like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack  
their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks  
to commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away  
their celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team  
woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee )  
although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire  
the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years  
along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl  
upham in _saving private ryan_  
some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen  
_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest  
only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick "

either way look out america bean is coming  
well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot  
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy  
it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help

welcome to the club , scott kalvert  
your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole  
dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based  
as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw )  
one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin  
jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school  
along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower  
the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner  
screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends  
as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long "" just say no "" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie  
jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out  
perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those "" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd "" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd  
without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack "

-1,"`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  
to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  
something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun  
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror  
judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move  
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably  
done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  
unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong  
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward  
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  
these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people  
boy , are these bats ugly  
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart  
they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do  
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  
but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers  
the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores "

-1,"the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films  
so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled  
it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly "" magical "" piece of work ? 
a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film  
looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater  
believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city  
the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon  
but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially  
the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public )  
problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded "" city "" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion  
setting the main plot in motion , mrs  hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels  
it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright  
here is where the film took a wrong turn  
up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience  
the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs  hogget is accused of smuggling drugs  
unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe  
the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is  
at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown  
at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs "
-1,"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept ""  
in summer 1994 , that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller ""  
in few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes  
the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison  
he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police  
few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose  
gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove's colleagues , friends and relatives  
dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber  
while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story  
and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed  
badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all  
screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama  
the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities  
the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay  
those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters  
because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times  
the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber  
his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself  
this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive  
the film have few bright points , though "
-1,"except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through  
bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly's ( paula marshall ) wedding  
lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again  
each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other  
molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses  
in molly's search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly's paparazzo joey ( danny nucci )  
meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan's wife rowena ( gail o'grady ) in bed  
the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious  
i'm no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy  
the message seemed to be "" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish  "" 
 "" family values "" aside , there's something cruel about all this  
perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy  
we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps  
reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable  
lilly's husband is a new-age flake who rambles about "" emotional valet parking , "" so we can write him off as irrelevant  
dan's wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch  
molly's husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she's too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan's wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick  
everyone else falls in love  
but still , that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main characters

-1,"from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli  
hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you , jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video  
it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one

with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track

-1," "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  
it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  
and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents  
it's worse than that  
it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness  
or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness  
in certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb  
in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens  
there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out  
this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  
what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and 
discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  
as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened  
this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch  "
-1,"this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation  
but lo and behold , here comes "" switchback , "" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as "" kiss the girls "" and "" i know what you did last summer  "" 
but "" switchback "" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting  
 "" switchback "" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching  
we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while  
he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit  
lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r  lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man  
in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado  
along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto )  
this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself  
or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about  
in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with "" switchback  "" 
for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction  
but "" switchback "" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense  
some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves  
what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? 
and dennis quaid ? 
 ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) 
ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in "" my so-called life "" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true  
>from a material standpoint , "" switchback "" is pretty empty  
but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote "" the fugitive "" and "" die hard "" ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals  
the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor "
-1,"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music  
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea  
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged  
unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original  
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended  
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died  
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together  
john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable  
first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie )  
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band  
next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band  
finally , there's buster ( j  
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band  
the plotting of the film is hardly original    it 
seems to be almost a clone of the original  
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale  
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role  
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original "
-1,"there isn't much good about this movie  
not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie  
so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled "" technicolor city ""  
in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end  
the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie  
the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum  
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything  
john must find out who he is before the "" strangers "" ( a  k  a  
mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy  
during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people  
any of these points however are completely "" erased "" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script  
as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film  
the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care  
the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true "" b-movie ""  
the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly  
lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn't deserve to have the word "" science "" in science-fiction  
if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie  
lets hope the next movie by alex "" i wish i was tim burton "" proyas is at least tolerable "
-1,"the most interesting part of "" can't hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to  
that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored  
the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party    almost 
too nicely  
for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film  
we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place  
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this  
after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with  
everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers  
except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there )  
unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film  
the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything  
however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes  
we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them  
and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being  
here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the "" american grafitti "" or , to a lesser extent , the "" dazed and confused "" cliche  
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party  
 "" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand "
-1," "" there will be another , "" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? 
true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway  
the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world  
given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions  
of course , it doesn't  
stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death  
i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality  
in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind  
it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating  
city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully  
there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success  
in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings  
 ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow  ) 
so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup  
this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead  
perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face  
at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave  
he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film  
kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank  
tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress  
the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve "
-1,"this movie stinks ! 
although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss  
i knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color  
this might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow  
and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training  
or what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision  
how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? 
now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through  
for example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating  
the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing  
but instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him  
duh ! 
ultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post  
when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects  
no , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing  
eventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier  
i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime  
i will just mention one final flaw  
brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia  
the rape occurred in west point , which is in new york  
he is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case  
he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point  
does he phone the doctor ? 
no , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline "
-1,"disney's "" air bud "" tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player  
granted , for a family comedy , it's not a very funny or successful idea to begin with , but it doesn't seem to matter -- "" air bud "" is surprisingly solemn  
save for occasional moments of forced slapstick , the movie wags its tale with a straight face -- not a very enjoyable approach

buddy , kevin

once the dog proves his on-court prowess , kevin's self-esteem rockets  
they both win places in the school's basketball team , with the animal as their mascot  
but before they can make it to the finals , snively surfaces to reclaim buddy  
everything plays out just as one would think : heavy on predictability , light on an actual story  
the movie follows a calculated chain of events -- kevin's gloom fades , snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller-style  
okay , that last one's a lie , but at least it would have been a quicker send-off than "" air bud "" 's courtroom climax -- no joke ! 
there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to "" splish splash  "" 
paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried , all in the name of formula  
the end credits note that "" no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture  "" 
that very well may be true , and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight , a movie cannot exist on feat alone "

a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands  
it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance  
indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times  
no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year  
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! ""  
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late  
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history  
unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature  
based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother  
if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania  
the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will  
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see  
but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end  
the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum  
frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving  
in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters  
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions  
crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain  
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers  
ah , but there is dunaway's performance "
-1,"i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy  
boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment ! 
after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater ! 
read on to see what i have to say

starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye  
possible stars ) 
 "" four rooms "" was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year  
key word here : "" supposed  "" 
four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast  
i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great  
the plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job  
he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems  
tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script  
it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy  
anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them  
the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot  
this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife  
the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite  
the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger  
the movie was just plain trash "
-1,"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge  
such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c  clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k  dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth  
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings  
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved  
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own  
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre  
with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe  
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission  
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son  
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney )  
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance  
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes "
-1,"one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , "" you'd better watch out for the skin deep  "" 
i'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don't watch skin deep  
skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards  
john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem  
i never saw edwards' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake  
you see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets  
as the movie opens , zach's wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress' hairdresser  
like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him  
in response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery  
if you're turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley  
skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters  
zach is a rich , '80s l  a  version of ritter's jack tripper character from "" three's company  "" 
like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he's the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye  
zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him  
consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis  
in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony  
to add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work  
for instance , vincent gardenia's talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender "

it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again  
this film from the seattle international film festival 2001's emerging masters series is easily one of the year's worst  
billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence  
two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry  
this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay  
hiding out in a prostitute's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie's conclusion  
if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love  
as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying  
or something like that  
everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost  
clarity isn't exactly this movie's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up  
not much could have really happened though  
the main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language  
lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there's a reason , but there's no purpose to anything in this film  
most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing  
it appears pi ? eyro ( who co-wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement  
he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go  
burnt money is pointless  
the performances are bad "
-1,"tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie  
the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster  
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious  
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  
tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences  
it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look ! 
art ! "" ) , 
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters  
because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas  
they're not real , sympathetic , or believable  
i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success  
tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage )  
one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself  
while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision  
meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host  
with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else  
however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers  
the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious  
tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point  
there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual )  
the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious  
for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage "
-1,"the kids in the hall are an acquired taste  
it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer  
maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen  
my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film  
as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv  
a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show  
the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so  
and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics  
brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression  
in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles  
doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug  
then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr  cooper releases the drug into the marketplace  
the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film  
at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long  
the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit  
but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough  
strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv  
the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating  
one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower "
-1,"john carpenter makes b-movies  
always has ( "" halloween , "" "" escape from new york , "" "" the thing "" ) and , by the looks of it ( "" they live , "" "" escape from l  a  , "" "" vampires "" ) , always will  
carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's "" ghosts of mars "" )  
like all those films prefixed by the very possessive "" john carpenter's , "" "" ghosts of mars "" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects  
in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic )  
dormant martians ( i  e  , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes  
all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- "" species "" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train  
officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james "" desolation "" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture  
in the second category we have ms  henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named "" desolation "" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try too hard  
in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also )  
state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department  
 "" ghosts of mars "" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry  
the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly

 "" jawbreaker "" is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one

just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything  
the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals  
rebecca gayheart , following roles in "" scream 2 "" and "" urban legend "" , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie  
pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino's "" jackie brown ""  
and rose mcgowan should just quit acting  
she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected  
mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the "" real "" actors are doing  
manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ? 
that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite  
stylistically , thematically & narratively , "" jawbreaker "" is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene  
though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands

it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture

there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period

and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it  
theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers  
that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers

joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l  a  , plotting joe's demise  
suffice it to say , the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city  "" 
theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising  
the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , "" look , joe's headed for the movie theatre ! "" 
followed by a shot of joe scaling mann's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like "" look , joe's headed for an amusement park ! "" and what do you know , there's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers  
the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves  
the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way  
underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands

i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times    and 
those were just chuckles at the most ! 
the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie  
wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j  d  mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end  
while in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for  
wayne and j  d  however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it's up to wayne and j  d  to try and begin saving silverman  
the performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat  
jason biggs right off the flop "" loser "" does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times  
steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself  
jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j  d "

-1,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another  
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over  
clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  
is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 
no , not really  
patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother  
as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest  
the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes  
i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school "
-1,"the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission  
he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses  
after they ricochet off his face , he says , "" not a good start  "" 
as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well  
in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed "" condor "" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war  
for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u  s  embassy in spain  
i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart  
watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe  
the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned  
it's almost a guarantee  
anyway     
condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly  
to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo )  
there aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something  
although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts "

-1,"i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper  
it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film  
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible  
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies  
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures  
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie  
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video  
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu )  
audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film  
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job  
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here  
and the kid actors are great , as well "

-1,"the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions  
that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright  
he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long  
now don't think i condone this just because i'm male  
my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her  
darnell doesn't think like this  
he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them  
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , "" i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? "" 
after all , it is largely darnell's fault  
if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does  
but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb  
you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her  
 ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) 
now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage  
one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with  
brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's "" immature play "" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life  
but all of a sudden she says yes  
but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! 
lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies  
look at this movie  
four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary  
there are some bright spots , though  
whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot "
-1,"often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray  
many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don't convert into a solid work  
although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent  
the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day  
the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last  
over time , the people have taken to themselves  
the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger  
so what happens when a "" tourist "" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? 
he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock  
it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby  
when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years  
it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages  
the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this musician  
the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray  
it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk  
technically , this film is a nightmare  
the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt  
the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases  
this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words  
in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven  
it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience "
-1," "" quest for camelot "" is warner bros  ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried  
the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production "" anastasia , "" but disney's "" hercules , "" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation  
this year , it's no contest , as "" quest for camelot "" is pretty much dead on arrival  
even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be "" pocahontas "" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this  
the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table  
kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest  
with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side  
 "" quest for camelot "" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney  
there's nothing here that differentiates "" quest "" from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage  
 ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra  
i rest my case  ) 
even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others  
in the end , it's a tie -- they all win  
that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse  
at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel "" urkel "" white and bronson "" balki "" pinchot sharing the same footage  
a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? )  
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good  
aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , "" quest for camelot "" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality  
and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way "
-1,"tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse  
the fugitive ? 
not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had  
there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? 
oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man  
both movies are on video  
make the wise choice and pick the fugitive  
there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable  
while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice  
learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary  
when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail  
director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son  
every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture  
in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something  
all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son  "" 
nothing more , nothing less  
dr  kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself  
libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough  
ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones  
winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles  
people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right "

mr  
magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented  
in fact , they were wrong  
mr  
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity  
it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas  
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr

-1,"hey , i've got a great idea for a movie ! 
ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! 
what's that ? 
sounds too boring ? 
ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are "" i'm in pain ! "" 
looks ! 
what's that ? 
that still doesn't sound funny to you ? 
how about if we through in some "" ewwwww ! "" 
looks ? 
still not funny ? 
if you answered "" no , that doesn't sound funny "" , then ( ding ding ding ! ) 
you're absolutely correct ! 
for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's "" seinfeld "" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion  
what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell  
what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs  
  
  
namely , talent ! 
backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce  
just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names  
the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do  
  
  
except run away and join an amish community  
first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn  
alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b  s  )  
allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! 
this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! 
the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing  
it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! 
bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either  
in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first "" power rangers "" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! 
now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it  
it bumped seven films up a notch on my "" worst of "" 1997 movie list  
that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list "
-1,"vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family  
as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors  
this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles  
also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes  
in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows  
it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue  
apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script  
at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey  
about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point  
by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags  
i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in  
they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film  
the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures  
rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments  
every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film  
which brings me to the best moment of the film  
the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play  
christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by  
it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen  
too bad "
-1,"plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients  
of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter  
pretty good premise , no ? 
critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller  
and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well  
sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole "" psychiatrist working against the clock "" thing , actually had me engaged at first  
but it's at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers  
we get the overly smart kid who manages to "" pull one "" over on the bad guys  
we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy  
we get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot  
and what about the film's main plot point ? 
why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day's end to do his part ? 
 ( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? )  
i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why ! 
and many , many more  
ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? 
i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke  
and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions  
badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone  
in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right ! 
watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool "" regular guy "" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture  
incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ? 
she was completely superfluous  
and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow

-1,"dr  alan grant ( sam neill , "" jurassic park "" ) is becoming disillusioned  
paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter

when the kirbys ( william h  macy , "" fargo "" ; tea leoni , "" the family man "" ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of "" the lost world "" ) he's disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders  
however the kirbys haven't given dr  grant their real agenda in "" jurassic park iii  "" 
of course , we , the audience , have been tipped off , given that the film begins by showing us eric ( trevor morgan , "" the patriot "" ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , "" election "" ) going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry ( and looks like cheesy rear projection )  
grant's established back home with a new right hand man , billy brennan ( alessandro nivola , "" love's labour's lost "" ) on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds  
he also pays a visit to old flame dr  ellie sattler ( laura dern , "" jurassic park "" ) , now married to another with a young son who calls grant 'the dinosaur man' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film's poorly imagined finale  
grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip , which is really an illegal gambit to save their son , that young paraglider  
the couple aren't millionaires , making grant's check bogus , and they're separated as well ( eric was with amanda's new boyfriend , not that that makes much sense ) , meaning we're in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining  
the kirbys hired hands ( and obvious bait ) are a threesome led by mr  udesky ( michael jeter , "" the gift "" )

as directed by joe johnston ( "" october sky , "" "" jumanji "" ) ( spielberg only produced this one ) from a risible script by peter buchman and the "" election "" team of alexander payne & jim taylor , "" jurassic park iii "" is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos ( a spinosauraus , which goes head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodons )

 "" end of days "" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan's baby the hour before new year's of 2000  
fortunately for the movie's sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers  
it's an action film's dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up  
imagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office  
arnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant  
if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it  
jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it  
jericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name  
arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can  
he shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil  
in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; "" you are a @#$^% ! & 
choir boy ! 
you are a choir boy ! "" 
those two lines marked the high points of this film  
a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor  
 "" end of days "" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne "
-1,
-1,"i looked at the "" internet movie database "" 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for "" best picture ( drama )  "" 
anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the "" great "" disaster films , and that's not really saying a lot for this film  
 "" earthquake "" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured  
on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster  
while this worked in , say , "" the towering inferno , "" it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters  
the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including "" skyjacked "" and that classic , "" soylent green "" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his "" shaft "" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! )  
in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l  a  ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ? 
guess again  he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there's genieveve bujold's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha     
- the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time  
as for the actual "" earthquake , "" it's rather a let-down  
there's a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing )  
this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored  
there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it  
there's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured  
but none of these are all-too suspenseful "
-1,"the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties  
produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens  
the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here  
gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes  
and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film  
what the film is not , however , is funny  
the plot centers around the return of dr  evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies  
austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday  
i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original  
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews  
i wish i had stuck to my first impression  
myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation  
and he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor  
but the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius  
this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old  
after some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention  
the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor  
for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show  
there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety "
-1,"eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights  
as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails  
but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds  
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy  
here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time  
they gonna get sexy  
they gonna get funny  
they gonna get drama  
they gonna get all of that  
i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network )  
here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense )  
and guess who's to blame ? ! 
the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film  
no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled  
murphy's awful script is the culprit  
let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : 
 ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture  
yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw  
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word  
and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating  
 ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast  
richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes "
-1," "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year  
it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand  
is it as bad as advertised ? 
oh yes , very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringe-inducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear  
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta )  
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous "
-1,"what are the warning signs of a * terrible * movie ? 
making it's debut at the dollar theater ? 
locally , chairman of the board did just that  
having the annoying prop comic scott thompson ( better known as carrot top ) in the lead role ? 
chairman of the board , once again  
how about an overly exhausted , paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence ? 
did somebody say chairman of the board ? 
that's right , carrot top's long dreaded major motion picture debut ( at least for a starring role ) is poking up in a handful of theaters across the country  
chairman of the board stars the obnoxious , wannabe-zany king of redheaded standup comics as a lazy but creative , inventive but uneventful generation x- er named edison  
living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small , rented house , edison bounces from job to job , always squandering away the money on his eccentric ( to say the least ) inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent  
this has the crabby landlady , ms  krubavitch ( estelle harris , best known as george constanza's mother on "" seinfeld "" ) , threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren't furnished post haste  
as luck would have it , edison soon meets armand mcmillan ( jack warden ) , an old surfer dude who just so happens to be president of the multi-million dollar mcmillan industries  
sharing a passion for more than just riding waves , armand is deeply impacted by the young inventor's notebook of dreams and ideas , and when the old man dies soon afterward , edison learns he is named a benefactor in armand's will  
predictably , edison acquires the entire corporation and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world  
predictably , there is a bitter nephew ( larry miller ) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot  
predictably , there is an attractive employee ( courtney thorne-smith ) whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist  
predictably , the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company it's most profitable and successful turnaround ever , all because he ran things by common sense and not greed  
it's as though writers turi meyer , al septien , and alex zamm ( meyer and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together ! ) 
pulled a plot out of a hat and worked carrot top into it  
the jokes , the "" surprises "" , the developments - all of them run such a predictable path , it may only be carrot top's signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films  
a movie this bad speaks for itself  
what's left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past ? 
the script is 100% recycled , the direction is hokey , and the acting is absolutely horrible  
it is only thorne-smith who seems to take her job seriously , an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor  
she certainly went beyond the call of duty - she has to kiss carrot top ! ! ! ! ! ! 
 ( barf bag , please ! ) 
movies like this give the audience nothing to do but ponder just how many synonyms for "" bad "" there really are

-1,"while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting  
in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone  
she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  
unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands  
giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies  
giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser  
naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy  
paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city  
paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul  
paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari )  
dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided  
they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser  
i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting  
jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence  
they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't  
then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort  
in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk )  
instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic  
she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma )  
she simply turns the film into a pity party "

-1,"you know something , christmas is not about presents  
it's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins  
at least that would seem to be the message of "" the grinch , "" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores  
hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season  
you know the plot : there's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville  
down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas  
the movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones  
it's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that's the case when jones' version is compared to ron howard's  
the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing "" mr  grinch "" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch's wide , toothless grin  
by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another  
first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie  
young wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season  
she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic  
cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski )  
are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? 
the grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch's rival for martha's affection  
not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought  
the casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions  
jim carrey seems woefully miscast  
while his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role "

-1,"libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood  
just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent  
she's convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish )  
time passes , and the friend disappears with matty  
during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell "" daddy ! "" 
and realizes that her husband is still alive  
libby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the "" double jeopardy "" amendment she can off him with impunity )  
when she gets parole , she's sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident  
after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty  
travis pursues , naturally  
 "" double jeopardy "" is a watered-down version of "" the fugitive , "" with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona  
although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script  
character development is thin  
travis' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story  
 ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick  
it's a long way to go for one line )  
there's considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there's something "" the fugitive "" didn't have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere  
libby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics  
this is judd's most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen  
let's hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around  
the quality of director bruce beresford's movies seems to depend on luck "
-1,"i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films  
i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them  
so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work  
i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning  
sigourney weaver , whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3  200 years later , scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her  
in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being  
im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now well just ignore it and move on  
why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? 
well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature  
these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research  
they ( yawn ) were wrong  
it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth  
theres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film , do it well   
i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me  
alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one  
there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot  
in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off  
another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to  
fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable  
if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right "
-1," "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while  
not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid  
unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven's gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad  
instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place  
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? 
of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek )  
most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps  
therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others  
 "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts  
 "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue  
the script , by bayard johnson and j  anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come  
comic books have better plots than this  
the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy "" george of the jungle  "" 
didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? 
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage  
when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week  
however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle  
at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man  
once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city  
most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of  
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 ) "
-1,"this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times  
it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam  
it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news  
the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped  
the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray  
ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement  
ray sr  ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business  
his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil )  
the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film  you 
should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them  
desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e  moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a "" sure thing "" at freehold raceway  
the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough  
there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray  
he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid  
so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? 
the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do  
as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen  
his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid  
and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together "
-1,"attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone  
should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic  
the film will work just as well as a silent movie  
chronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing  
first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth  
there isn't one of these characters worth caring about  
the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of "" people magazine  "" 
among others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd  
and unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say  
it's new year's eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party  
structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars  
monica's apartment is in "" noho , "" an area that one of the guests describes as "" so cool , all of the poor people live there  "" 
typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love )  
they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course  
she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story  
the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year's eve birthday  
 "" cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , "" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie

a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche  
a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche  
a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche  
at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche  
complaining about cliches = cliche  
ok , ok  
so we always hear about cliches  
but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! 
not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen  
they might as well use this as a training film : "" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's ""  
karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison  
she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive  
aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past  
he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt  
and if she refuses ? 
who knows what he'll do to the kid  
 ( cue sinister laughter ) 
this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin  
the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant  
i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot "" twist "" , etc  , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera  
basinger is absolutely vacant "
-1,"bats is this year's camp flick  
with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity  
as for the rest of us , well    
i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway  
follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot  
i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based  
it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats  
when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate  
it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious  
why has he done this , you ask ? 
because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things "" a little better , "" even if that means the death of all mankind  
so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world  
of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture  
consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave  
the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out  
what do they do ? 
do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? 
nope  
they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes  
what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes  
we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick "
-1,"forget get carter  
instead    
get me a cup of coffee  
what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? 
did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? 
when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads  
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city  
get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown  
stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up  
a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey  
that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul  
stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past  
too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges  
get carter is a simple story  
stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore )  
when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter's way ""  
he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee  
carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough  
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties  
what a minute ! 
this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey "
-1,"capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived  
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead , they got john r  leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a  ) the director's style , b  ) the special effects , & c  ) the treatment of the story and characters  
a  ) mr  leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping "
-1,"look ! the new version of "" psycho "" came out and the world didn't end ! 
i guess gus van sant really isn't the bringer of the apocalypse ! 
unfortunately , though , that "" psycho "" didn't end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it  
van sant's controversial "" re-telling "" of alfred hitchcock's classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered  ) 
without benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck  
being an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word "" suck "" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan  ) 
director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations  ) 
the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time  
suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original  
sadly , that did not occur  
it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original "" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen  
in moore's case , the film would have been helped if "" the x- files "" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! 
from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! 
mortensen ( who i liked in "" g  i  
jane "" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point  
sam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that's about it  
mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory  
anne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen  
at least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can't be said for most of the rest of the cast  
the best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama's boy , norman bates  
he's not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice  
the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk  
there is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film "
-1," "" idle hands "" is distasteful , crass and derivative  
if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness  
plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo  
the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers  
the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed  
along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends  
the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them  
that is the level of this's atrocity's humor  
the movie treats death as a joke  
 "" idle hands "" is gruesome and morbid  
the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish  
i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen  
it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life  
and i can only presume that the writers of "" idle hands , "" terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today's young people and their values in a satiric vein  
however , it's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people  
with the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as "" idle hands "" should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths  
 "" idle hands "" is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside  
but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings  
the time is not right for this type of movie  
and as far as "" idle hands "" goes , the time may never be right "
-1,"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3  
they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning  
you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news  
no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise  
something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car  
 ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture  ) 
of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? 
the backseat ? 
the next car ? 
thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering  
what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff  
our other surviving regulars have become estranged  
sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program  
murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death  
the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour    or a combination of people  
scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive  
ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  
with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent  
conceptually  the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 "
-1,"deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie  
this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive  
but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit  
braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger )  
their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket  
however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables  
braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives  
braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie  
kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful  
the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises  
however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost  
take a look at l  a  confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled  
the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot  
for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable  
there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation  
they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay  
the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable  
not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught "
-1,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value  
it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point  
the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series  
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  
john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense  
the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one  
their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing  
the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  
we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville  
first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr  nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it "
-1,"okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? 
whew  okay  
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe  
even i know that you need more footage than * that *  
and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves  
the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie  
at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace  
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die  
a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received  
later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom  
and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary  
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc  ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good  
some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice  
can't beat that )  
all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected  
not romantic at all , and only funny in some places  
so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? 
or the fairy godfather ? 
she can * float * now too ? 
and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? 
tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's "" witchcraft "" in the end ? 
would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ? 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? 
it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome  
the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables  
the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) "
-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly "
-1,"the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end  
if you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end  
now if you're a regular reader of mine , you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? 
no , it definitely is not  
melissa joan hart ( from abc's "" sabrina , the teenage witch "" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team  
adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend  
apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance  
so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud  
will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? 
will this crazy scheme work ? 
do i care ? 
the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy  
what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly  
i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy  
there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to  
here there's nothing    
just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance  
do me a favor kids , go get a job or something    
just shut the hell up  
in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits "
-1,"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion  
joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer  
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup  
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical  
the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him  
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school  
joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents  
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch  
the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever  
his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes  
this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist  
now , that's a smart kid  
but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends  
one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing  
throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) 
question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class  
nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted  
what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody  
the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) 
tells him his grandfather is all right  
his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well ,  "
-1,"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality  
he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict  
but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation  
a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category  
the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york  
during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed  
in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community  
emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder  
concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover  
that isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways  
things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal )  
using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film  
even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent  
but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith  
the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles  
role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them  
first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better  
screenplay by robert j  avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch )  
but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community "
-1,"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story  
but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought  
for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction  
our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be  
brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy ""  
regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well  
his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing  
true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins  
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily  
the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors  
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino  
more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively  
donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious  
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music  
inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us  
it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's  
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface  
in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations  
donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them  
 ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! "" 
i hear from springfield way ? ) 
so the movie is cliched "
-1,"have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? 
well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation  
but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond  
oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc  
in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down  
using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office  
the law firm's employees get a good chuckle  
the audience gets a good chuckle  
the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd )  
there is something compelling about this mysterious woman  
despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her  
after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago  
after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state  
the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions  
but he does not alert the authorities  
he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss  
the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past  
his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life  
his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation  
she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman  
he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation "
-1,"whenever u  s  government starts meddling into other countries' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says "" look who's talking ! 
what have you done to the indians ? "" 
however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes  
hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s  
those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america  
one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers  
the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century  
when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u  s  government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation  
however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless  
with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign  
general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u  s  army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest  
instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt  charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall )  
together with young lt  britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo  
geronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors "
-1,"'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
chris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs  doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  
based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult  
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  
soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin ( sam neill ) very curious  
andrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  
it shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul  
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  
then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do  
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love  
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  
ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  
what makes us human ? 
the thoughts ? 
the emotions ? 
is it possible to become human ? 
at what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? 
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  
it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously  
when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it  
in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards "
-1,"starship troopers is a bad movie  
i mean , a really , really , bad movie  
not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre )  
looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme  
that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth  
the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? )  
as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand  
eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet  
as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing    
 "" what ? "" 
you say , "" laser beam weapons ? 
sonic weapons ? 
phasers ? 
photon cannons ? ""  
nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons ! 
i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry  
as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon  
two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing  
this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies  
again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons ! 
in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves  
he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared ! 
this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? )  
i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway  
i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly "
-1,"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse  
it's hard seeing arnold as mr  freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? 
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser  
in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself )  
with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! 
parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma  
yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film  
anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie  
it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing  
sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going  
it's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources  
aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films  
i'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days  
speaking of action , where was it in this film ? 
there was hardly any explosions or fights  
the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt  
the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film  
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down  
i also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much  
there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget  
the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom  
it's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie "

 "" mafia ! "" - crime isn't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998 
on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see "" mafia ! "" , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as "" the godfather , "" "" goodfellas "" and "" casino ""  
at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep  
but by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle  
i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film  
 "" mafia ! "" 
chronicles vincenzo cortino's ( lloyd bridges ) life  
separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life  
but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord  
following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr )  
like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women  
 "" mafia ! "" is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as "" airplane "" and "" the naked gun  "" 
but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work  
as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based  
crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence  
it's a tough genre to parody  
i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say "" please "" as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored  
there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law  
a gunman shoots him several times  
the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena  
i think that i just gave away the best part of the film "

the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her

bloody gang warfare ensues

most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )

-1,"suicide is pointless , everyone should know that  
so what's this movie like ? 
you guessed it    
pointless  
the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them  
when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever  
that's what the press materials for the film probably say  
now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time  
boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as    
well as committing suicide  
the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window  
the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on  
then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on  
is that a joke ? 
is that supposed to be amusing in some way ? 
from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in  
performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides  
woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well  
dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well "

-1,"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air  
the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl  
the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met  
if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should  
cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained  
and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h  i  mcdonnough  
cage should have known what he was getting himself into  
he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production  
the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance  
in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time  
that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness  
while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact  
audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production  
in fact , the marketing people are counting on it  
no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded  
director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland )  
what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense  
a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely "
-1,"the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence  
it's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense  
and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? 
james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor  
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train  
at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role  
chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop  
he's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown  
that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg )  
nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life  
what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me  
i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann )  
i'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff  
i'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way  
there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story  
one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense  
i don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director  
i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act  
one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner  
he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me  
 ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all "
-1,"i've got to admit it    
i'm a huge jim carrey fan  
i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good  
until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying  
sadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be  
carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i  
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof )  
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other  
once again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills  
those who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original  
the original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny  
here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise  
instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly  
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself  
in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach  
but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style  
there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between  
they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber "
-1,"i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development  
hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  
plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people  
critique : "" speed on an ice-cream truck "" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for  
this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr  , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written "" , that we just had to crack up  
that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it    3 scenario ! 
and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters "

he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield

if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc  ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr  connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching "
-1,"synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium  
comments : this movie was boring  
plain and simple  
entrapment should not have been boring  
it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible  
it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current "" hot topic "" in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999  
it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences  
so , what went wrong ? 
plenty , unfortunately  
the major problem with entrapment is its script  
it has a been-there , done-that feel to it  
nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours )  
the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i  e  
 "" 4 days to the millennium "" )  
this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days  
the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth "" surprise "" revelation is made  
entrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion  
the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production

-1,"jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma  
it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal  
would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? 
let's find out  
plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead  
that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge  
critique : three words : not enough action ! 
simple enough ? 
not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments  
and a romance angle ? 
why , one must ask    why ? 
i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie  
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? 
how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? 
what a letdown  
even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film  
in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the "" hits "" for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called "" screenplay ""  
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time  
the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines  
but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly  
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? ! 
what a mess  
then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story  
well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film  
there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving "
-1,"a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon ! 
hunter s  thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as "" gonzo ""  
soon after the book was written , hunter s  thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke  
and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie  ) 
although the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson's own assessment of the novel as "" unfilmable  "" 
the main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road  
it was written and edited by hunter s  thomspons , relatively sober , at his home  
so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor  
hunter s  thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him  
not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas  
despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge  
unfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp's ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration  
and the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr  raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson's ) and his riding companion , dr  gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned  
the film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr  raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs "

do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? 
well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half    only to make up and hug in the end  
aaaaaaaahhhh    
plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill  
critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special  
and i'm being nice ! 
how junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit  
the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot  
wow    how

-1,"violence is bad  
violence is ugly  
violence breeds yet more violence  
kids , don't try this at home  
this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest  
written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles  
 ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia  ) 
if you piss a "" family "" member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs  
a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another  
it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from  
unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work  
there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what  
then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family  
granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense  
instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again  
the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning  
there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose  
all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend  
he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away  
another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes "
-1,"to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery  
it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history  
it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible  
worse , there's the promise of a sequel  
why ? ! 
save your money  
some films go quickly to video  
this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre  ' 
in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species  
most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos )  
survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives  
the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons  
dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage  ' 
travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth

when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan

-1,"by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered  
after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines  
the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r  lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction  
as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects  
lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination  
all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist  
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse  
lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years  
he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise  
two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere  
lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game  
it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start  
there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation  
we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp  
a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film  
quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated  
it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes  
even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course  
the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat "

what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?

-1,"drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others  
she has perfected these characters in movies such as "" the wedding singer "" and , most notably , "" ever after  "" 
now she's back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - "" never been kissed  "" 
you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary  
trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don't mean steve ) invented the printing press  
the premise is simple  
barrymore's josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens are feeling and doing  
josie ( she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance  
this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd  
now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence  
these are among the many problems that plague "" never been kissed  "" 
screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie  
their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation  
and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school's most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability  
ok , so "" never been kissed "" is not a sociological expose of today's high school scene  
however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character  
among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment  
any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say "" get me rewrite  "" 
to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with  
she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her "
-1,"i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota  
for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt  
then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another  
feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face  
feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him  
red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams  
enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom  
united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight  
freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations  
there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father  
it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks  
the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin  
most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' "" i will dare "" on the car radio  
you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota  
unfortunately , you would be dead wrong  
i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got  
what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality  
suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable  
the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations  
vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood "
-1,"i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering  
if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history  
it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee  
that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor  
and you could just smell the disaster brewing  
if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up  
ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves )  
when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called "" an alan smithee film "" -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it  
among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them  
it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes  
what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times  
michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade  
the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film  
by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as "" bad a-- "" and "" badder a-- "" , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified  
those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn  
not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears  
the producer is a "" liar "" who "" slept in the white house ; "" the media are "" maggots "" and "" leeches "" working for publications like "" the new york slimes "" and "" newsleak "" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke )  
it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation  
this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth  
the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away "
-1,"woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger , because that's what's required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as--of all things--a psychologist  
not since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude ! 
alas , mickey rourke , we hardly knew ye  
story opens with a campy kick--willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy  
she goes splat , he goes ugh , and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind  
really  
the good doctor then moves to sunny l  a  , where he rooms with an old college chum ( scott bakula ) , a therapist who's getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group  
buddy bites it in the second reel ( no surprise there ) and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats  
for his troubles as therapy man , willis gets to share some cut-from-nc17 love scenes with the lover's jane march while dodging nails , cars , and rattlesnakes  
why'd it have to be snakes ? 
color of night is the worst movie of the year  
period  
forget north , clifford , or , heaven help us , even on deadly ground  
here is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can't help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming  
for starters , the "" group "" is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis  
these are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy ? 
playing a prissy obsessive/compulsive , cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif , alone , may set the psychology profession back ten years  
the plot's a wreck with laughable dialogue , pointless pov shifts , and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes  
director richard rush , who once helmed freebie and the bean , doesn't seem to mind  
unfazed by the nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations , he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set-pieces to make the effort almost worth watching  
his token freeway chase is ok , but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala ( most recently ) fatal analysis "
-1,"here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? 
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  
in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was  
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions  
we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers  
i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me  
on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both )  
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  
the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting  
in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie  
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? 
probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  
in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j  o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation  
their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes  
the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  
aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board  
the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  
the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) "

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
the big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one  
gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis  
 "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre  
it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for  
audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects  
battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens  
in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking  
we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources  
each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people  
professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play )  
of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments  
the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable  
the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! )  
we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent  
in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent  
yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk  
they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) "
-1,"the formula is simple  
trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one  
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few )

that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ? 
that you get your best sex on the net ? 
if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would  
as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone  
denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone  
it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives  
the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea  
a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea  
and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes  
you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone  
here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank  
as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines  
in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for  
both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone  
with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ? 
denise calls up scores with some inspired moments  
mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine  
 ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain  ) 
but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie  
the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters  
and the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will  
we get the point  
the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears "
-1,"the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending  
watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise  
when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification  
this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more  
good surprises make movies fun to watch  
then there are the bad twists  
you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid  
screwed perfectly suits the latter description  
what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on  
by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs  
larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing  
whoops  
screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments  
norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch )  
when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars  
too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home  
now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping  
of course , everything that could go wrong does  
the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad  
but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear "

-1,"in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife  
in the second , he was avenging his daughter  
in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend  
fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz  
however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for  
this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways  
kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers  
even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p  ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter  
white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them  
the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh )  
fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade  
however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3  paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting  
however , the hand of a veteran director j  lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring  
there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end  
the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years  
there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics

after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control  
yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far  
ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve "" demolition "" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home  
when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed "" the commander , "" "" the rookies , "" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches  
filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences  
the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story  
ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose  
attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced  
most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube  
with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to "" me and my brother when we was kids  "" 
apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment  
but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite  
yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt  
and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand  
characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? 
as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed  
eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson  
what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle  
explosions are fun  
and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will "

-1,"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick  
take the professional , for example  
it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions  
it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension  
the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant  
the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated  
one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door  
her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d  e  a  
agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off  
leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother  
the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both  
writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin  
there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting  
but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe  
the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop  
leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies  
jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda  
natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either "
-1," "" return to horror high , "" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once  
the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before  
but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again  
on one level , "" return to horror high "" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on  
watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , "" scream , "" and "" scream 2  "" 
on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout  
unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat  
and the last thing the film wants to be is a "" behind-the-scenes "" look at an exploitation film being made  
the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be  
and to top it all off , the "" twist "" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time  
there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through  
if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean  
the premise of "" return to horror high , "" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place  
but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene  
well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in  
but other than that two-minute distraction , "" return to horror high , "" is certainly no great shake

and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax   "
-1,"synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs  
in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat  
comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film  
one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( "" saturday night live "" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey  
not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it  
what was she thinking ? 
never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial  
she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood  
two men woo her ; tony the "" security consultant "" wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music )  
a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings  
86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours  
a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony  
why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? 
that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered  
regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism  
they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly )  
also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex  
the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's "" character development  "" 
someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts )  
rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her  
suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die  
oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) "
-1,"you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man  
while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies  
even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film  
it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly  
i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good  
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved  
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  
things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland )  
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous  
the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years  
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial  
through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell  
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting  
as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas  
the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action  
gooding jr  does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual  
the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work )  
nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct "
-1,"so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? 
well , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here  
this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! 
it's like i said    this 
movie sucks  
plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet  
critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie  
uneven , would be another  
the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go "" somewhere ""  
but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix  
in a sci-fi movie ? 
well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement  
ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact  
mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well  
of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story  
ugh  
what a friggin' mess  
films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again  
didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? 
didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! )

i don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie  
but in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him  
the film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit  
wayne and garth , these two are not  
rather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury  
driving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club  
`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change  
their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label  
just as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers )  
and , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film  
however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in  
their sad lives take on a whole new direction  
they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene  
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women  
but their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them  
the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke  
actually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff  
alas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film

that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle

you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film  
at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in  
to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not  
after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr  smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's "" stream "" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting  
they encounter another ship  
they board it  
alien spiders attack them  
they return to their ship  
the other one explodes  
they land on a deserted planet  
and so on

as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo  
actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v  s  
mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is  
the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags  
unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i  q  
the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment  
woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places  
her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper  
now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr  right , and that he'll be a virgo  
later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo  
it's not love at first sight , however  
things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner  
in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad "" white "" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber "
-1,"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight  
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show  
when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt  
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back  
when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv  
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king  
after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view  
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin  
yes , i do    
1  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans  
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously  
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously  
i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 
i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has  
2  there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title  
this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in "
-1,"under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review  
however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary  
even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk  
the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients  
distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself  
cut to the "" next fall "" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument )  
after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has "" the sixth sense "" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead  
and this , as they say , is where the healing begins  
the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of "" siskel and ebert "" )  
although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one  
here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated  
and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment  
stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion  
after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power  
it's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie  
in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come  
and when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all  
it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level  
i won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder  
now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand "

the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher  
first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in "" mallrats , "" and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from "" suburbia "" ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again )  
they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky

too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie

 ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience  
have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ? 
well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! 
i say again    what the shite were they thinking ? 
okay , so where do i start ? 
first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal  
so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two "" lovers "" go through the motions until the "" betrayal "" occurs  
whoopee , big surprise  
second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part  
why ? 
well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! 
i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here  
every look in jolie's eyes screams "" psycho "" !

-1,"the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting  
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers )  
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder

how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me  
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me

-1,"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge  
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise  
after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom  
the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping    
and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 
love  
so far , so mediocre  
but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance  
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status  
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture  
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand  
not that there is much of a romance to begin with  
try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters  
celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard  
as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other  
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural  
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish  
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting  
the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling "
-1,"staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone  
well to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things  
first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence  
not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway  
in 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player  
i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not  
he's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference  
now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark  
fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes  
yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me  
i'm usually very easy on films  
i loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed  
granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun  
there is virtually no fun in this film at all  
i couldn't have cared less  
it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing

-1,"there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs  
one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film  
two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta  
to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth  
a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior  
sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs  
battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes  
here's the `plot  ' 
the year is 3000  
mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group )  
a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below  
the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver  
a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons  ' 
he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base  
after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end  
jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use  
then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet  
the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits

in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point  
but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie  
this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws  
get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie  
travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson )  
it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell )  
let the investigation begin  
with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case  
things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve  
woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar  
with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable  
here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room  
there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb  
director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it  
the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess  
it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace  
a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package  
from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this  
still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits "

nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband  
now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans  
if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further

i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals  
most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production  
one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison

-1,"after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker  
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , "" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done  "" 
to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done  
sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter  
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous  
start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie  
the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers  
worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983  
meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother  
influential club dj julian dice , a  k  a  "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star  
in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on "" the roller coaster of superstardom  "" 
in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom  
i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows    
you'll figure it out  
the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun "
-1,"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  
after the familiar 'a long time ago     ' 
opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  
however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park  ) 
they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters  
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent  
there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help  
there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod  
the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother  
there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen  
the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  
qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for  
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time  
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy "
-1,"i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films  
when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing  
but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance  
tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively  
baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse  
jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems  
sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out  
ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it  
annie is a happy woman  
she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content  
but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it  
five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet  
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity  
here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five  
the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory  
sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell  
but none of them can save the film from being a bore  
its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming  
the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue "" sleepless in seattle , "" whom she has never even seen  
it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice "

the wacky fashions are here  
  
  
and the music  
  
  
and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle  
the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings  
both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds  
robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together  
i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny  
whatever his appeal is , i've missed it  
 ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments )  
the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself  
idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup  
he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene  
we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie  
other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie "

-1,"sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime , but this has got to be one of the worst  
a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting , "" the specialist "" is about as exciting as an episode of "" dragnet , "" and about as well acted  
even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness  
who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? 
unless you saw "" blown away ""    
 "" the specliast "" of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job  
his credo is killing bad people , not innocents  
and that's why he makes big bombs  
so anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc )  
turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young  
so she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked  
yea  
also into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly  
using the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open  
these are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film  
the film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes  
it's just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time  
and for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub )

-1,"the happy bastard's quick movie review 
wild wild west 
a better name for this movie might've been "" wild wild waste ""  
warner bros  , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad  
but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way  
they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer  
wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon  
if warner bros  had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is  
heck , ten times  
as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well  
here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair  
they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path  
as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess  
but the acting doesn't help either  
kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado  
smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib  
branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard  
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention  
her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass ""  
director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either "

-1,"the characters in jonathan lynn's "" the whole nine yards , "" yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999's "" analyze this "" and "" mickey blue eyes , "" 2000's "" gun shy "" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one-dimensional caricatures  
when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot  
in a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done  
unfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh-o-meter available , i'd guess that it briefly ascended around 2  5% of the time for me  
suffice to say , the comedy in "" the whole nine yards "" works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck  
nicholas "" oz "" oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec  
trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door  
walking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy "" the tulip "" tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison  
once getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz  
in her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy's whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy's wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage  
upon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz's dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside "" the tulip , "" and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill's dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself  
have you got all that ? 
because there is more  
much , much more  
and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures  
how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn's 1985 comedy classic , "" clue : the movie  "" 
going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble  
since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing "" comedy "" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill's shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark "

-1," "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder  
every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act  
it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment  
but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon ""  
forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs  
by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about  
the main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio )  
he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time  
richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown  
this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for  
he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle )  
he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis  
though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen  
moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life  
captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey  
they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's  
once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise  
this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard  
etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand  
it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view "
-1,"for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects  
but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark  
the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him  
he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars  
then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter  
raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing  
raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck  
but these are the least of billy's problems  
billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer  
billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis  
she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it  
she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments  
if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it  
this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing  
while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it  
there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose  
take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy  
the film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything  
granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us  
the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles "

robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss  
he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city  
there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona  
there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers  
of course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce  
although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all  
this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run  
it's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties  
even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy  
there also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce  
in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy  
in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all  
towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , 
the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across

lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell  
however , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player  
in fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier  
nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however

tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive  
this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail  
what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane  
when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior  
but even on it's own , u  s marshals is a pretty lousy movie  
while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time  
while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u  s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately  
to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not  
snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later  
tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge  
the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  
i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film  
there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing  
nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie

there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time  
recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script

-1,"after 1993's "" falling down , "" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director  
since then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( "" the client "" and "" a time to kill "" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise  
although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential , the publicity for his latest release , "" 8mm , "" raised new hope  
it promised to be something unusual  
it wasn't  
the plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs  christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband's belongings  
the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher's "" batman & robin "" )  
because murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs  christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead  
by combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl's name and tracks her to los angeles  
with the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff  
the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader's "" hardcore , "" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter  
both films are modeled on dante's "" the inferno , "" of course ; "" 8mm "" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil

max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , "" dance with the devil and the devil don't change ; the devil changes you "
-1,"take two old and dying men , a lifetime of regrets , a house full of sins , a thoroughly despicable man , enough lies , insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed , then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibian-based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia , the newest film from paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights )  
the movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time  
would that the stories were worth the telling  
earl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer  
bedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short  
his much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death  
having married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied  
earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to "" seduce and destroy , "" his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable  
meanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer  
not as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children  
the current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits  
on the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a "" somebody  "" 
his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish  
jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film  
grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c  reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection  
this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie  
and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs  
yes , frogs  
assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn't seem to faze the characters much "
-1,"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 )  
can you say    the 
third times not a charm ? 
plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week  
critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture  
when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign  
i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes  
when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign  
and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster  
it blows  
or as they say in french , "" eet blows ""  
could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? 
maybe  
could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? 
perhaps  
or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? 
naaaaaaah ! 
a bad movie is a bad movie  
on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in  
branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped  
smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others  
i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie  
then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage "
-1,"the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film  
since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's "" take on me "" in his yellow miata  
why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? 
honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie  
man , was i wrong  
corky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots  
fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety  
kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( "" you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps  "" )  
when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence  
predictably , hijinks ensue  
if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker  
the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity  
corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( "" that's pronounced pees-ahn  
it's french  "" )  
he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr  magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom  
and not a good sitcom , i mean  
the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face  
and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation "
-1,"what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ? 
you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma )  
so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ? 
you get an audience in a coma  
in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises  
when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long    
the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt "" big momma "" ( ella mitchell )  
the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail  
however , big momma is called away on an emergency  
sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma  
and let the comedy begin ! 
big momma's house is the definition of a "" gimmick "" movie if there ever was one  
the plot can basically be summed up as "" martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman ""    
and even that description is too wordy

-1,"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? 
expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible  
in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison  
watching glen or glenda ? 
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious  
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time  "" 
the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose  
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles  "" 
finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people  
  
  
all with their own thoughts  
  
  
their own ideas  
  
  
  "" 
while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead  
had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? 
probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch  
unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script

-1,"i want to be involved in show business one day  
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse  
this movie proves it for me  
i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up  
i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne  
they didn't  
kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles  
this film is different  
the cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he's one of those directors who's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn't really give an impressive cast anything to do  
the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy  
the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze  
his accent is so heavy , you can't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice  
that's the trouble with me , * i * notice  
schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does  
patrick stewart was the person i'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would've been so much better  
or sean connery , but not arnold "" i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life "" schwarzenegger  
i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would've been nice if they'd casted a star that had talent for the role  
akiva goldsmith's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film  
in a regular batman film , they'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is  
there is talk of a fifth batman movie "
-1,"some movies i should just skip  
my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program  
true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon  
but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  
but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 
turns out i was right , mostly  
inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick  
at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! 
i want more zany here -- and -- here  "" 
 "" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful  
i want the audience squirming in their seats  "" 
 "" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts  "" 
 "" what does this scene do ? 
character depth ? 
but where's the zaniness ? 
i don't see zany here  
if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "" 
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  
michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes

-1,"for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene  
now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood  
i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them  
chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt  
his final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy  
this he refuses do and runs  
however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job  
cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations  
some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring  
the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked  
tut tut  
the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content  
mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun  
director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots  
chow's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site  
and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that's damned unforgiveable  
to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow  
it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video  
this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer  
 ( did he have no say so at all ? )

frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean

however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either  
sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane

-1,"preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? )  
michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him  
michael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york's character  
here's some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside's character  
now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil  
how do they fix that ? 
make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! 
there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking    
oooooo scary  
but even that wasn't enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside's character is gay ! 
it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense  
my main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off    
anything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren't shown with any sense of urgency or importance  
for example , at one point york's character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it

-1," "" practical magic , "" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one  
the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years  
at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest )  
switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes )  
when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house  
add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of "" light-hearted whimsy , "" and you have a pretty good idea how messy "" practical magic "" is  
after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed  
it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching  
it is not charming or entertaining in any way  
and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body  
whatever  
the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character  
there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side  
no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people  
the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way  
in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines  
i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the "" batman "" series with "" batman forever "" and "" batman and robin  "" 
 "" practical magic "" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , "" addicted to love , "" with meg ryan and matthew broderick  
i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since "" practical magic "" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is  
i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself "

there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons  
they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation  
watching "" flubber "" really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy  
it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story  
the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere  
we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist  
within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is  
phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ? 
he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one )  
we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten  
sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has )  
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related  
christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too  
what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! 
wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day  
one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film  
the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter  
it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny  
unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing "
-1,"since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama "" schindler's list "" and directed 1993's intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career  
what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h  macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective  
the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama  
based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass  , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes  
jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water  
suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h  macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out  
also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case  
coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience  
perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning  
watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children  
in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home  
not only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes  
considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl  
in "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness

-1,"senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far  
director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies  
marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage  
however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up  
in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet  
but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel  
he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr  wheedon ( brad dourif )  
as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold  
using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses )  
naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor  
the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here  
the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor  
there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot  
the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous  
i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? 
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? 
to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard )  
apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie  
his "" intervention "" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh  
and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one  
in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses "

-1," "" spawn "" may be somewhat of an older film  
in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it )  
but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing  
it wasn't the worst film of year by any means  
it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year  
but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my "" worst of 1997 "" list  
the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year  
performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy  
in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! 
even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality  
i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed  
  
  
well , annoyingly unprofessional  
john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite  
he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional  
but the main problem i found with "" spawn "" , as with most films that wind up on my "" worst of "" lists , is that it was just plain boring  
i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film  
sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion  
never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way  
even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again "
-1,"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time  
a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac  
jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel  
while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count  
the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie  
the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story  
but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics  
a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp  
they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids  
sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer  
at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production  
since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive  
i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries  
if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise  
the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work  
using as many methods of murder as they could  
none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife  
nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work  
one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again  
the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning "
-1,"this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name  
before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok  
but the idea of doing a movie is insane  
it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all  
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  
yet it still fails  
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that  
the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe  
so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate  
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper )  
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in  
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves  
the acting is ok  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi  
however the film drags and is no fun  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made  
this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth "

-1,"the tagline on random hearts reads "" in a perfect world , they never would have met  "" 
in a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie  
the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production  
dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department  
kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire  
although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs  
dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair  
the rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process  
two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film  
dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare  
all the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter  
kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal  
these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers  
random hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells  
although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other  
there is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships  
veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both  
other than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts  
however , it is also hard to compliment it  
had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be "
-1,"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood  
ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year  
but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank  
no number of name changes can help this picture  
it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster  
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute  
the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises  
the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies  
from that moment on , it's all downhill  
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point  
it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured  
basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs  
there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions  
it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense  
the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around  
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion  
graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle  
unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it  
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition  
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc "
-1,"there is a rule when it comes to movies  
a sequel is never as good as the original  
there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them  
now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience  
don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire )  
they made this movie before they were stars  
judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons  
it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey  
apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger  
apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day  
and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them  
unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character  
while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control  
 ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you  ) 
to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag  
there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning  
let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick  
man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is  
this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities

this movie was boring , slow , boring , and slow  
there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat

-1," "" love to kill "" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes  
at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman  
danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his  
everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs  
much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another  
sound confusing ? 
it is  
i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity  
in some respects , it works  
but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess  
characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen  
the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister  
but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them  
well , i didn't , at least  
one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza  
here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing  
here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it  
i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona  
michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him  
like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline  
 "" love to kill "" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much "

a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare

no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway  
no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere  
each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified  
you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream  
powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake  
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins

then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race  
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise

the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits "
-1,"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter  
these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen  
that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags  
observe the opening sequence  
a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips )  
they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles  
however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut  
he is undecided  
this happens for about 10 seconds  
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness  
the lights suddenly go out  
cisco is surprised and says : "" whoa    let's 
go ! "" 
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence  
the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film

-1,"the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results  
when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler  
meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne  
the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d  hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim  
not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal  
i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail  
the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe  
literally  
speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking  
besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical  
the sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to  
unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be  
take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst  
you're being hunted by a dragon ! 
what do you do ! ? 
sing a happy song ! 
martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ? 
believe it ! 
with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc  , etc  , etc  , "" more and more as the film progresses  
no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end  
and where does this character's personality change ? 
hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him !

the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no !

in the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment  
only amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script  
as rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault  
the director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets  
sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim  
her fellow students delight in tormenting her  
of course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers  
as the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs  
rachel's girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made "" love "" to her the night before spurns her  
 ( he gets major points in his black book for this , but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death  )

remarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest

-1,"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see  
therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas  
despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters  
a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there  
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust  
only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash  
the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments  
the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth  
governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses  
captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart  
pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time  
she even comes complete with insignificant best friend  
again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is  
this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work  
the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation  
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes  
the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch  
the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , "" colors of the wind  "" 
mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more  
the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character "

the cover-up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends , two wives and several innocent bystanders  
this was a real audience pleaser at toronto , but it did not do much for me  
 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
- directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland  
- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them  
one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute  
- several people with no moral compass  
they started out with a simple , innocent little cocaine party ( ! ) and by accident look what happened  
they have one moral person among them ( daniel stern ) , and one totally amoral person ( christian slater )  
it is more selfish to let the amoral lead , so they do  
- this film is strange , but not really funny or biting  
black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange  
there should be some element of satire  
the satire is missing here  
i did not find myself laughing here either  
what we have is a strange crime tale  
- one just does not care what happens to these people  
- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently  
if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation  
- it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book "

our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp  
enjoy ! 
so much for the first attempt to catch her

too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition  
one by one she goes after the others  
eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure  
the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned

-1,"when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right  
predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years  
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater  
am i enjoying myself ? 
is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 
this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week  
so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review  
daily news ? 
negative  
reelviews ? 
negative  
epinions  com ?

this was nothing new  
american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures

-1,"i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy  
it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless  
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999  
in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing  
more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship  
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant  
in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage  
it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years  
convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly  
anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will  
jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p  m  on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child  
there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends  
it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters  
at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist  
screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs  
from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees  
it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development  
by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless "
-1,"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade  
tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity  
most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus  
those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends  
unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal  
sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process  
on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself  
one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974  
in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence  
that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry )  
unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality  
death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out  
before the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film )  
kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime  
bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine  
although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film  
the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade  
on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey  
unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang  
the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget "
-1,"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie  
a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage  
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid  
godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close  
there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly  
frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning  
there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
 ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse "

the film poses the question "" what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "" 
it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica  
it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time "" shattered image "" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care  
these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been  
it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining  
of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style

--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested  
an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him  
for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered  
when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  
they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm  
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  
the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  
during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled  
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  
in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  
after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's  
because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered  
if there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty  
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  
if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  
compelling , but ultimately not  
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images "

the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire  
we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology  
as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out  
there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all  
i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film  
once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence  
rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon

-1,"the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length  
if you haven't already figured it out , i didn't like this movie very much  
the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme  
tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society  
he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march  
back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city  
 ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city  ) 
anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision  
tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city  
he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa  
of course , jane is hot on her ape man's heals  
the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys  
sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? 
it's actually an improvement over the real thing  
the acting is just plain awful  
i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting  
jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes  
compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies  
added to the sound problems was the cinematography  
this film was filled with beautiful african scenery  
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me "
-1,"synopsis : back-up quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school , even though he'd rather read "" slaughterhouse five "" than the playbook

in the meantime , moxxon's kid brother forms a cult , and a bubblegum-blond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback  
comments : since i usually review horror and science fiction films , i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie  
 ( pun intended  
thank you ! ) 
varsity blues was produced by mtv , and it really shows  
several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for  
the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst  
the adults all have problems , of course , and , as one-dimensional characters , they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs  
yes , this movie represents high school life in mtv-land  
this is a land where your health teacher is also a part-time stripper , your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck , your kid brother forms a "" cute "" cult , your football coach is an uncaring , obssessive madman , and your friends' lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked  
all you , as the main character , want to do , however , is read "" slaughterhouse five "" and attend brown university in the fall  
well , at least this is a little more realistic than mtv's "" the real world  "" 
varsity blues stars james van der beek , this week's teen tv star making the leap to the big screen  
he plays the hick moxxon adequately , though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle  
 ( "" you dawn't own mah life ! "" 
who would want to ? ) 
jon voight , the stock evil guy in countless other movies , is , surprise , the stock evil guy here  
but is he really evil , or is he a product of society ? 
after all , everybody , young and old , in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football  
maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil  
the film's screenplay never answers this burning question  
at times , iliff's story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes , but , before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie , they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game "
-1,"the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that's the problem  
the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it  
 "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance  
it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun  
it wasn't always this way  
tim burton's "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge  
the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel  
batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night  
the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent  
batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline  
those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck  
 "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness  
the blame lies with director joel schumacher  
a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes  
unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do  
 "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who  
while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti  
a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film  
 "" batman and robin "" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions  
it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one "

-1,"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start  
recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  
a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e  l  e  ) that wiped out the dinosaurs  
what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world  
firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  
to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much )  
mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted  
 ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment'  ) 
it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  
however , the film simply fails on that note  
the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials  
she's still making good money though  
t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast  
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  
robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all )  
leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  
warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) "
-1,"instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching ""  
i have a name for it myself : "" gross ""  
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too  
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ? 
this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence  
instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa  
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him  
after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's "" psychotics ward ""  
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr  )  
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career  
of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison  
and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor  
he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell  
let's get one thing straight : dr  theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off  
any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way  
not good old theo  
no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now  "" 
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems  
director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs "

boy , was i wrong ! 
in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes  
by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers  
not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense  
of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest  
in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie  
oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other  
i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie  
often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing  
how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? 
too many  
i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc    
simply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience  
my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch  
you'll be looking at it for most of the movie

-1,"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  
the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review  
that's not a good sign  
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him  
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment )  
bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! )  
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a  fox ) , who have never met  
to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex  
first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them  
oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin  
back to the store  
now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay  
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 
nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too  
talk about coitus interruptus  
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies  
the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
at the extreme  
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  
it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting "
-1," "" i would appreciate it if you didn't do that again  "" 
starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk  
directed by chris nahon  
rated r  
it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another  
when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners  
when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape  
kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment  
now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself  
li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question  
the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone  
the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch  
they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton  
but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side  
the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever  
oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle  
 "" kiss of the dragon "" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately  
there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain  
this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor  
there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot "
-1,"if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? 
if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? 
while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people  
what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation  
celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows  
allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more  
branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery  
the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another  
unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity  
aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless  
branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly  
the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch  
i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? 
-- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved  
he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him  
in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ? 
i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity  
the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances  
davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie  
some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people  
only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life  
the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging  
what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its "" themes "" are  
allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way "" normal "" people look at celebrities "
-1,"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival  
on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  
they need not have wasted their time  
the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor  
there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click  
i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either  
keep cool just isn't very funny  
the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  
although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost  
too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh  
qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments  
however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade  
it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film  
you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  
at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving  
cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  
although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying  
headache , as i said  
the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) "

starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne  
running time : 132 minutes 
we go into a movie theater , boom ! 
the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on  
we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is  
why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into  
again like this past summers hit "" stigmata "" , "" end of days "" may be worse  
it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some "" rosemary's baby "" , along with "" the devil's advocate "" a little "" exorcist "" and some "" stigmata "" here and there  
whala you have "" end of days "" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific  
sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers  
the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next  
jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist  
he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes  
he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie  
that's pretty much it on plot  
it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went  
as for arnie ? 
good role , ok performance  
i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts  
the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film  
in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions "
-1," "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be  
almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence )  
crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous  
 "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters  
it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation  
by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed  
john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp  
of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy  
while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked  
to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket  
desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation  
lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation  
he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl  
what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness  
press junkets are a haven for control freaks  
studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand  
generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel  
the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews  
every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things  
the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets "
-1,"at times , you'd think edtv would be an entertaining film  
i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? 
but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone's problems and settle his own  
mcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans  
frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys  
he overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries  
the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed's step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments  
jenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i  e  
can't hardly wait , and krippendorf's tribe  
woody harrelson , as ed's brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , "" my brother pissed on me  "" ) 
elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed's biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show )  
ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner's opinion  
i hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie  
it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed  
edtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood  
extracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother's girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance  
i got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out

-1,"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" 
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece  
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  
and i was impressed  
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie  
it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs  
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do  
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont  
wow  
isn't that a memorable name ? 
i could just say it over and over again  
sebastian valmont  
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach  
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips  
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist  
the ones who do are irritating  
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants  
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn "
-1,"about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! "" 
at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like  
when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark  
every year , a couple films like this are released  
you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  
this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain  
 "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements  
and you thought "" the saint "" was bad  
 "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule  
well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi    or 
is he ? 
after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  
and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  
the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever  
soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him  
there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  
the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue  
sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  
the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one  
it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances "
-1,"in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don't cut it  
sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess  
for those who remember disney's fantastic "" adventures of ichabod crane "" , it is actually superior to this  
disney's version was at least interesting , while burton's film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights  
while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off  
ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders  
the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman  
now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow  
sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster  
in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable  
no one could stop him , not even ichabod  
by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought  
burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes  
he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails  
another pathetic element of the film was the script  
like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims  
he completely butchered the story to pieces  
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked  
the acting by depp was quite notable  
he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner "
-1,"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing  
partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr  
as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world  
thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985  
now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  
in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  
meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter  
she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break  
of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  
he didn't  
right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  
the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
the script , however , is painfully bad  
it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl  "" 
i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well "
-1,"it's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film  
that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression  
indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel  
the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians  
the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas  
well , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced  
here's the story  
cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr  pavlov  
 ( oh , how witty  ) 
she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film  
cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again  
a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula  
at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater  
how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ? 
it's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon  
and depardieu    
how can a french guy have a bad french accent ? 
and never mind the toilet brush haircut  
the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he's a rottweiler "

that is their hero of course , whom is kicked out of the wcw  
well here is where the plot thickens ( lol ) : the two wish to rescue the king , and put him back into the wcw but not that easily , because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them , while david's father wants him to become a police officer , and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots  
what a plot eh ? 
 "" ready to rumble "" is one of those films that tries to be funny , but sadly fails miserably , everything in the film is imcomprehinsable , and even the trailer wasn't funny  
the actors are dull , the script awful , and the plot which there isn't much of     really 
annoying  
i'm not quite sure how great actors like these , and very funny actors too , are given such a lame script , and directed in such a childish manner , that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days  
this review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't much going for the film , if anything at all  
only one big laugh is in the film , which isn't all that hilarious "
-1,"this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one  
not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure  
an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance  
the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience  
this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching  
summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr  ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country  
ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy  
he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous  
he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy  
he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment  
so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball  
then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures  
tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan  
if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing  
as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination  
biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father  
the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher  
summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural

-1,"i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft  
seriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off  
the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue  
an example : "" that [car crash] must've been awful    for 
everyone involved  "" 
you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what  
i know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don't mind cardboard cutouts , but please don't let the cutouts be so damn bland  
one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters  
aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren't on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade  
alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot  
good thing brad dourif is here , but wait    he's only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he's just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo's nest  
which brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it's unoriginality  
the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven's and williamson's great success )  
urban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn't quite succeed  
it's best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at "" that girl in the noxzeema ad "" ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : 
female protagonist : why ? 
villain : why ? 
why ? ! ? 
congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend "
-1,"midway through "" anaconda "" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says "" i thought this movie would be my first big break  
instead , it's turned into a disaster  "" 
truer words have never been spoken  
 "" anaconda "" is a monster movie with a lousy monster  
it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable  
it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box  
as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens  
the main difference between the giant snake in "" anaconda "" and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic  
 "" anaconda "" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years  
animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world  
but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame  
in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air  
the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper  
here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon  
what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie  
but enough about the phony snakes  
now it's time to talk about the lousy story  
heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest  
stoltz tells his crew "" pray that you didn't forget your bug spray  "" 
apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect "

-1,"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take  
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2  
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals  
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy  
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute  
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition  
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig  
that'll do  "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script )  
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget )

-1,"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire  
usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein  
to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat  
but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you  
by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors  
not in these times  
all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade  
without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity  
which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half  
not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower  
with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims  
you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains  
blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual  
the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost  
it's all hokum and nonsense , of course  
but the filmmakers play it straight  
unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings  
you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter  
another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero  
also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs "
-1,"come on hollywood , surprise me  
stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset  
the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls  
personal , because his niece is one of the victims  
it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist  
freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl  
we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to "" dominate "" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem

a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story  
perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue  
so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? 
and as for comparisons to seven    oh 
please ! 
kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass  
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here  
one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting  
two , the script has no sense of humour "
-1,"this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st  
elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also  
i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory  
if i had to list a reason why     
but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film  
adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher  
he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court  
one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st  
elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball  
morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists  
so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack  
good music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire  
suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach  
it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else  
until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film  
the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure  
the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse "

eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck  
living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar )  
maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances  
on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love  
their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again  
like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high  
their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy  
she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter  
during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy  
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer  
she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage  
he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years  
during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role )  
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her  
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life  
she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey )  
but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was  
maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him  
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing "

at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! 
the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of "" the x-files  "" 
bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident  
at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant  
grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob  
it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people  
four writers are credited with contributing to the story  
that doesn't seem possible  
despite being a solid two hours long , "" return to me "" adds little to the "" boy meets girl / boy loses girl "" formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving  
duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along  
since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny  
he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on "" the x-files "" comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered )  
there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy  
regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo  
the only redeeming quality of "" return to me "" is its hilarious supporting cast  
the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie  
carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly  
when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status  
when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , "" this is bob ! 
his wife is dead ! "" 
the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news  
also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe

paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms  
as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up  
benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role

when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr  ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there  
along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation

during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor

a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and "" excess baggage "" likely covers its territory

it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride  
the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention  
they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs )  
of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves  
thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians  
the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse  
i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny  
all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series  
one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series  
creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death  
a person can only take so much  
we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it  
it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful  
it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful

and slow motion  
in the film's first scene  
the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen  
leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante  
i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points  
he's concerned about buddy jason gedrick's heroin abuse  
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin's character's sister  
he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch )  
but none of this ever really amounts to anything  
it seems that moresco's greater concern is to provide that intangible "" slice of life "" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone's been trying to evoke since scorsese's early work  
so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other  
 ( do people actually do this ! ? ) 
we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not  
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose "
-1,"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes 
director : luis mandoki 
screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) 
cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage  
review by : geoff berkshire 
i'm not an overly cynical guy  
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years  
however , i have my limits and i also have standards  
this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day  
the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james )  
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean  
the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her  
upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it )  
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down  
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing  
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship  
of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love )  
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened  
the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film  
there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending  
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel  
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since   "
-1,"there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do  
i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda  
something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob  
deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test  
sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait    excuse 
me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion  
there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold  
as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients  
a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits  
and up go the lights  
it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream  
here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j  o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic  
writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously  
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes  
case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda  
in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive  
he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable "
-1,"plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive  
they get into an accident  
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares  
what's the deal ? 
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out    
critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package  
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly  
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly  
so what are the problems with the movie ? 
well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled  
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on  
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained  
now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem  
it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes  
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? 
not really  
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining  
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding  
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! 
okay , we get it   "

-1,"when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games  
why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? 
the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw  
this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack  
the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the "" outworld "" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity  
the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined  
here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation  
how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , "" i knew love would keep us together , "" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh  
there are some seriously stupid things in this movie  
take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the "" inner winds "" , generated by earth's magma flows  
you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast  
how fast ? 
as katana says , "" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all  "" 
what ? 
later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn "" red "" williams , otherwise known as "" saber "" on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu  
how do we know this is where she went ? 
there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii  
remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign  
i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are  
there's a lot of major flipping action , too  
the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another  
do they land and immediately get into the fighting ? 
does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? 
do they collide in mid-air ? 
no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away  
why did they need those metal balls to travel ? 
everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b  
i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics "
-1," "" easely one of the worst films of the year   "" 
with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  
the result is somewhat predictable  
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry  
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture  
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug  
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it   satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold  
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc  
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him  
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  
no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )

-1,"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer  
unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge  
he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one  
he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot  
the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia  
adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits  
robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar  
however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall  
she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave )  
so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding  
as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one  
to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia  
from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae  
and then there's the music    
learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow  
as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols  
2 , 3 , and 4 ! 
while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot  
at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person "
-1,"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion  
but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned  
however , protocol forces me to do otherwise  
soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent

matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck )

sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her  
as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him  
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party  
annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions  
she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself  
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material  
in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion  
when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d  
carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation  
we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 
and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here  
carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness  
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around  
the second lamest device , of course , is the , "" oh , it was all a dream "" resolution "

i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me

-1,"talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! 
spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls  
it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch  
when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name  
the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented  
there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat  
the film itself doesn't really have a plot  
it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall  
the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas  
the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd    even 
when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff  
whew  
for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos  
from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf  
heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld  
richard e  grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford  
the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film  
neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring "
-1,"the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into "" heartbreakers  "" 
ray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office  
while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , "" just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! "" 
i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , "" geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? "" 
over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind "" heartbreakers "" predated "" three's company  "" 
suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s  
all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv  
while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special  
women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts  
on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about "" booze and broads "" and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers  
the adults laughed and laughed  
 "" heartbreakers "" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated  
in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft  
i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project  
perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s  
if so , they were sadly mistaken  
the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team  
it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator  
having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night  
the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary  
just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them

oh yeah , there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me , you won't care much about the "" plot "" in this film    
critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! 
the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here  
it's like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink )  
and the scariest part of it all ? 
check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven ! 
i say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half-assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror  
now i'm not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed "" funny sketch "" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on "" saturday night live ""  
there are a couple of funny one-liners , but mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags  
add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film's website isn't even up yet ! ! ! 
what the f * * * ? ! ? )  
i do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take-off-- miss this and you've missed any reason to see the flick )  
i especially liked his one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman's head turning  
very funny ! 
unfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where's my car , and other action movies like charlie's angels and mission impossible 2  now help me figure this one out , will you ? 
isn't this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? 
 ( or maybe that's just the title of the film f-ing with my head )  
well , i'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! 
the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel  
unfortunately for us , all we're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might've been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs  
but as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year's film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course )

the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through  
presumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off  
movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence  
 "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny  
unfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs  
unfortunately , there are no laughs  
the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence  
instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "" boogie nights  "" 
however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market  
wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed )  
the movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him  "" 
the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money  
his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst  
melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine )  
one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom  
however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter  
so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it  
not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper  
of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin "
-1,"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction  
the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel  
so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel  
congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better  
it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good  
the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l  jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting  
several years ago dr  norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered  
the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien  
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s  
suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft  
included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber )  
together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets  
one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship  
what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances  
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects  
the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film  
it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen "
-1,"this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable  
in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend  
while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her  
over money ( how original )  
while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition  
now she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works )  
now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims  
skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better    
but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away  
as i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with  
he was much more of a supporting character  
which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with  
i feel this film had alot going for it  
originality not being an issue  
the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive  
the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better  
the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place )  
i was just left unsatisfied in the long run "
-1,"stars : armand assante ( mike hammer ) , barbara carrera ( dr  
charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : 
in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel "" i , the jury , "" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in "" miami vice "" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol  
however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim  
beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" )  
after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic  
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles  
for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss  
and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic  
 "" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code  
although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book  
rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women  
it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself  
no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling  
it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor  
 "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made  
the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it's alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 )  
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget "
-1,"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own  
not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d  wood jr  has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time  
of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent  
boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" )  
boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent  
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 )  
his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste  
if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion  
unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around  
 "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's  
his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot  
but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling  
the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found  
in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions  
it's more middle ages than space age  
the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life  
these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society  
however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years "
-1,"i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days  
for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another  
such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures  
the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps  
the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places  
sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time  
janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons )  
with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers  
with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker  
but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated    
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy  
then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes  
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 
the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene  
pure and simple , the klumps is a failure  
its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes  
any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process  
it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash  
hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes "
-1,"as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother  
yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face  
this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched  
 ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat  
and she's right , it is that bad  ) 
directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best  
boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts  
amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more  
but who's counting ? 
and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic  
meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad  
it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything  
herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes "" your geyser's a geezer , "" and "" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack  "" 
as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as "" a walking kodak moment , "" are celebrating their 18th birthday  
as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski  
as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men  
as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire  
their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers  
the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week  
hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material  
this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in "

jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by    waking 
up  
she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals  
paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station's 4th of july getaway giveaway  
bikini-ready julie invites boyfriend ray ( prinze , jr  ) , who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off  
until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell-liner himself , that is  
unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who's sweet on julie  
to make a long story short-i can't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster  
not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn't working properly ! 
 ( you think killing is hard ? 
try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor's "" i will survive "" now contains the lyric "" i still know what you did last summer ! "" ) 
all is not lost-ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co  
this picture is really about breasts : two of them  
julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan  
based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me-he gets jennifer love-hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp ! 
lucky bastard  
i didn't like i know what you did last summer and i can't say i liked this continuation any more or less  
the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ?

-1,"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars  "" 
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind  
but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e  t  
the extra-terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens  "" 
why ? 
because there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars  "" 
all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films )  
if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film  
of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time  
 "" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time  
the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet  
luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians  
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" )  
a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride  
after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel  
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home  
after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth  
 "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film

-1,"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  
why ? 
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey'  
i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon'  
but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster  
this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  
you have been warned  
of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  
when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally )  
of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' )     
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  
that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole  
sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  
the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 )  
after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction "

harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck )

stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence  
yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama  
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late  
that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip )  
they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer  
in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live  
 ( only in the movies , right ? ) 
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa  
loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be  
despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree  
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper  
ain't they a pair ? 
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative  
by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe  
this revelation exists purely for its own sake  
aberdeen doesn't know where else to go  
weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa  
if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional )  
headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance  
if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more  
it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders "

-1,"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek  
following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace  
set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek )  
we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook  
coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him  
the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter )  
also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin  
when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies  
his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end  
guess who wins ? 
nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love  
there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow  
van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes  
also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character  
he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock  
voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out  
the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better  
on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 )  
scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man  
larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening "" whipped cream bikini  "" 
it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) "

smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3  "" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name  
  
  
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice  
the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy  
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with  
indeed , "" scream 3 "" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original "" scream  "" 
at the scene of each murder in "" scream 3 , "" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer  
to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films  
 ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is )  
unlike its predecessors , "" scream 3 "" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer  
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is  
the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? 
the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? 
the driven young director ( scott foley ) ? 
the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? 
the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random  
wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen "
-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet     "
-1,"i cried during _babe_  
i admit it  
the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children's film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental  
such , my friend , is the power of cinema  
when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations  
they can't possibly drop the ball on this one  
can't miss  
can't possibly miss  
they missed  
what went wrong ? 
after much thought , i supply three general rules  
 ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i  e  , penny marshall's dreadful "" preacher's wife "" )  
betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here  
it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b  
take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show  
 ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i  e  , 
 "" con air "" )  
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time "
-1,"reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , "" analyze this , "" i asked myself , "" how could this miss ? "" 
robert de niro ( "" taxi driver , "" "" raging bull "" ) , billy crystal ( "" city slickers "" ) , lisa kudrow ( "" the opposite of sex "" ) , and director harold ramis ( "" national lampoon's vacation "" )  
these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of "" analyze this "" was very funny  
unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times  
the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen  
middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well  
although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow )  
in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won't even admit to having anxiety attacks  
ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death  
it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben's potentially happy life gets into danger  
 "" analyze this "" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time  
admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline  
since "" analyze this "" bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot  
one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop  
coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , "" clockwatchers "" and "" the opposite of sex , "" lisa kudrow's throwaway "" girlfriend "" role is an incredible step down  
sure , kudrow's fellow "" friend "" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in "" office space , "" but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston  
kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place  
chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character  
finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on "" saturday night live "" ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears  
too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal  
once "" analyze this "" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben "
-1,"everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country )  
but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure  
i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co  
as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director  
 ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) 
for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth  
six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly  
but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing "" amadeus "" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed  
the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race  
 ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world  ) 
every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment  
he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western  
 ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers  ) 
he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version  
that's no excuse-someone generated this footage  
muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia  
consider such curiosities    
picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ? 
 "" don't ask  "" 
worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt "
-1,"ugh  that about sums this movie up  
just , ugh  
the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence  
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of    how to put this ?    
dignity ? 
not quite the word i'm looking for  
you understand , right ? 
and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever'  
leave it to america to screw the whole thing up  
>from the 'geniuses' that brought us "" independece day "" , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had  
while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline  
summing up the movie is simple  
heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  
simple as that  
matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show "" mad about you ""

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes "

-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored  
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is )  
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight "
-1,"the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film "" the world is not enough "" is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming "" james bond will return  "" 
oh i certainly hope not  
with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , "" the world is not enough "" is the best example to date that "" 'enough "" is enough  
in this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original  
we've got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines  
we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them  
we've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache )  
and , as has been the case since 1977's "" the spy who loved me , "" we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr  fleming  
we've also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from "" tomorrow never dies  "" 
while originality was never the series' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts  
i can't think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- "" the world is not enough  "" 
in addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as "" coal miner's daughter , "" "" nell , "" and the "" 28up "" documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s  
you get the "" talking killer "" plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age  
and you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can't hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film's opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond's souped-up "" fishing boat "" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her  
later , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out  
these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards  
in and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , "" braveheart "" 's sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she's terrible ) , "" wild things "" ' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she's laughable ) , and judi dench as m  dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond's walther ppk )  
brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you'd expect of the former "" remington steele "" star , but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck "
-1,"when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store  
masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read  
of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history  
given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie  
let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie  
the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible  
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars  
we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that "" deja vu "" is too polite a term to use in describing it  
 "" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate  
tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either  
so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? 
yes , there is  
one incredible good reason  
his name is frank langella  
langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years  
here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece  
dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper  
given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision  
skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right

is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? 
is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? 
or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? 
i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed "" documentaries "" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera  
i'm talking about films like "" 8mm "" and its director , joel schumacher  
with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- "" batman & robin , "" "" a time to kill , "" "" batman forever , "" "" the client "" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence  
is "" 8mm "" something you really want to see ? 
probably not  
the first two-thirds of "" 8mm "" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core  
then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence  
and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further

there are better ways to waste two hours of your life  
nicolas ' "" snake eyes "" ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder  
welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this  
welles certainly makes it look easy  
and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues  
the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c  scott in paul schrader's "" hardcore  "" 
occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task  
there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa  
 "" 8mm "" doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it  
the irony , of course , is that schumacher and "" seven "" scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product "

wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor  
most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? 
perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle    
but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements  
the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success  
a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor'

-1,"topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end  
it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other  
there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay  
for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line  
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them  
at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives  
this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing  
unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained  
with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama  
such a disappointment after such a brilliant start  
the actors are all quite good with ms  danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive  
the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable  
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film  
it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles  
that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock  
up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place  
while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film  
not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it  
this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film "

written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire  
sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed  
the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth  
the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub  
all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes  
 ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments  ) 
with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter  
the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it  
the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship  
in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards  
the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer  
when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze  
at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms  
with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce  
the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having  
too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment  
the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground  
one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies  
surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing "
-1,"capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight  
gibson's script only adds insult to injury  
johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie  
i say "" awesomely "" because it's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged  
keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an "" information courier "" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head  
he is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal  
one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it's only followed up on in a token fashion  
for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers  
what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there's no room in this movie for any of that  
the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly  
 ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped  
but that's another essay  ) 
anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark  
why newark ? 
maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that's why  
there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos )  
the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture  
it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn't kill him  
handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity  
the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind  
everything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace "
-1,"so i went and saw this film right , it was called "" battlefield : earth "" , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it  
well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than "" mr  magoo "" , "" blue in the face "" , or "" jaws : the revenge ""  
roger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as "" alien "" and "" star wars "" , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it's quite depressing  
the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times  
the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i've heard  
the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous  
here's the so-called plot : earth 3000     man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo    i 
wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those "" man-animals "" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's "" the green mile "" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! 
one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work  
of course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) 
forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind  
our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair  
i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it's terrible  
everything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted  
in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself "

orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events  
the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the "" future "" never do  
for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth  
we're still here  
the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse  
we're still here  
some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! )  
also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like  
if it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring  
the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video  
it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1  33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed  
also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods  
audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this  
i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me  
certainly i never expected a remastered print  
curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case

-1,"ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking  
these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous  
if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect  
hackers is guilty of all of these crimes  
to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore  
those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled "" goofs ""  
this is the section for mistakes in the movies  
well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology ""  
and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct  
the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking  
more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller  
miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers  
the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems  
he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old  
the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer  
dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi  
oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film  
really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said  
it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi  
thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do "

unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie  
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie  
not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video  
it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house

but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end  
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues  
it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms  
first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof  
he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production  
bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them  
they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections  
he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school  
his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch  
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy  
moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts "

-1,"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line  
it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin  
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol  
the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas  
but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message  
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia  
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply  
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country  
everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war  
the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never  
there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether  
the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide  
the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined  
he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage  
the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless  
she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick )  
what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her  
even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures  
her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing  
since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use "

a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay  
also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending  
not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews  
so much for truth in advertising  
roland emmerich , who's later "" independence day "" would look like "" the 400 blows "" compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens  
in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it  
it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out  
they're decipherer ? 
a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr  dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word  
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 
so there is a hokey ending ! 
duh ! 
he figures it out in about a minute  
yea  
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , "" jack "" o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position )

-1,"these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run  
1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s  
few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia  
however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period  
one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas  
being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l  a  policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l  jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement  
two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies  
the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines  
the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct )  
the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers  
the rest simply doesn't work  
only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh  
others would probably wince at the lameness of humour  
some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while  
but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort  
the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones  
the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel "
-1,"i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest  
not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment  
let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond  
mr  freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum  
i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be  
after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony  
not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one  
robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman  
mr  freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond  
a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons  
my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her  
not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? ) 
notice if the road was on fire ? 
i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but  
  
  
  
it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment  
as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie "
-1,"you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning  
you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight  
surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting  
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue  
it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word  
though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore  
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such "" classics "" as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls  
the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits  
i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad  
it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money  
our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual  
he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone  
for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? )  
he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for  
i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short  
the subject and the style seem to have been made for it  
unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome  
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary  
it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is

-1,"the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there  
as the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts  
if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently  
joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas  
he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender  
mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid  
the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah )  
as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path  
where exactly does all this go ? 
that's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself  
his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac  
and another  
and another  
at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth  
that is most certainly the case here  
joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself  
unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied  
if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all  
the real blonde is not without some amusements  
it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest )  
but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside "

part of the reason why the film doesn't work , i think , is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  
here , everything has been cheapened  
they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ; they have no motivation except for sex , sex , beer and sex

with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay  
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored  
in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider  
demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world  
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2  i can't remember seeing a character quite like her  
after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety

-1,"stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama  
the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths  
keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on  
this film should be brilliant  
it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance  
however , it can't hold up  
although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded 
some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them  
in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid  
in this film , serious means dull  
the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them  
the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while  
in fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances  
however , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance  
however , it's not all that bad  
as said above , the action scenes are well done  
theres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well  
in fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997  
if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending  
cop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film  
hugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it "

and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  
hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  
time passes  
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc

he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king

a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider  
thus , ahmed becomes the "" 13th warrior  "" 
on the trip , ahmed manages to learn the vikings' language by listening to their fireside conversations

ahmed , who's called "" ibn "" by the vikings , forms friendships with herger the joyous ( dennis storh ? i ) and the viking leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich )  
when they arrive in the other kingdom , the thirteen warriors discover that they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves

-1,"at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise  
its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power  
he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents  
given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge  
eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom  
along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell  
talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! )  
fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade )  
then , everything ends happily  
unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds  
what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes  
never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly  
this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia  
after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards  
wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? 
if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? 
and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? 
these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film  
another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off ! 
in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure  
even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work  
it just completely fails altogether miserably

-1,"if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? 
the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight  
everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess  
actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city  
not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials  
with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not  
his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny  "" 
not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project  
it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first  
meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines  
his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers  
the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface  
i haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne  
then there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary  
not to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing  
and so on  
the film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is  
rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material  
the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad  
the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in  
willis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience "
-1,"a new entry in the "" revisionist history "" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal  
kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g  gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in  
when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers  
the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with  
when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned  
during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation  
this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of "" deep throat ""  
from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad "" dick "" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy  
at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial  
the band manages to stop right as dunst screams "" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! "" 
much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot  
several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film  
if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not  
the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible  
i don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience  
the only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast  
i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein  
those two characters are the sole basis for my rating  
i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour  
their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) "
-1,"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line  
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons  
the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_  
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself  
this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico  
by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border  
one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg )  
calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side  
but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them  
viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations  
there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire  
director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture  
what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction  
yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling  
the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters  
they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status  
with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive  
it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work  
the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence  
even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction "

the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like "" scream , "" "" halloween , "" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know

-1,"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right ""  
a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" )  
for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween  
urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special  
for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh ""  
alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention  
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it  
it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt  
the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them  
unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering  
if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla  
but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced )  
allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation  
these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? 
sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while  
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three  
despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes  
as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer  
you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface  
all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected  
all the better for that elusive crazed killer "

sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters  
nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise  ) 
an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy  
the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together  
however , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long , and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end  
although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead  
the problem is that de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with  
he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored  
nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it's no use  
they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable  
yes , another problem with the film is that there's no-one to root for  
we're supposed to be on cage's side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film  
however , his change is sadly unbelievable  
poor gary sinise's character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way  
the film's use of flashback quickly gets boring  
while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go  
they certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie  
there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one

she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon-to-be first president of argentina  
they fall in love and eventually marry  
sounds pretty good , doesn't it  
well the story gets better , as eva goes on the "" rainbow tour "" across europe , trying to win respect  
eva duarte was a wonderful lady  
however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood  
i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right  
they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar  
although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance  
as the "" spiritual leader of argentina , "" madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line  
but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film

-1,"one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain  
 "" so , are we all going to die ? "" 
the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town  
the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough  
and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so  
populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors  
one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture  
besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie  
graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines  
director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening  
the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr  's dark and ugly cinematography  
the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water  
onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie  
christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom  
edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie  
coming to their "" rescue "" is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman  
he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan  
the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom  
along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver

brit love story in the offing  
effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite  
he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making  
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school  
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas  
in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music  
karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company  
chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about  
if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo    , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat  
kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much    
a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy  
personally , give me those cheap laughs any day  
i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story "
-1,"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company  
based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams )  
when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u  s  ambassador  
her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages  
she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead  
meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her  
however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! 
this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england'  
it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written  
newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs  valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad  
kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script  
the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs  dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing  
in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements  
however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades  
an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st  james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline  
its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! 
jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile "
-1,"i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness  
i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based  
then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold  
unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them  
the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally )  
of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye  
their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human  
using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection  
the first half of the movie succeeds on most points  
cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions  
unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive  
as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right  
her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning  
likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film  
when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel  
the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel  
the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie  
the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes  
the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats  
this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears "
-1,"there was probably a good reason that the warner bros  studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened  
and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why  
this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago  
fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky  
it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role )  
it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit  
seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa  
no    not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa  
it's the environmental protection agency  
i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! 
taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice  
written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks  
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in  
seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket  
but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free  
that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches  
slow and plodding , this project is a total mess "
-1,"all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin  
in fact , the script was in development well before 1992  
still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference  
no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting  
speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy  
speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep  
what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate  
at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer  
but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics  
the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other  
screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism  
it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work  
part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already  
there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour  
inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together  
the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass  
davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit  
in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection  
for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines  
you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens "
-1," * * * be warned    
the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing

i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water

-1," "" jack frost , "" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching  
this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other  
jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them  
when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas  
halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies  
switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death  
when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit  
jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise  
 "" frosty the snowman , "" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn't work at all  
after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , "" jack frost , "" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play  
since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , "" what happens after you die ? "" 
or , "" how does it feel to be a snowman ? "" 
but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie  
the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this  
michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? 
i have always liked kelly preston  
she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , "" nothing to lose , "" and , "" addicted to love  "" 
joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent  
in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman  
this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son  
since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue  
some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : "" you da man , "" says charlie  
 "" no , i da snowman , "" replies jack "
-1,"if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny  
by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr  loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld  
is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ? 
 ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp  ) 
1869  jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain  
how will loveless accomplish this ? 
well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course  
bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train  
 ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued  ) 
racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's "" hip "" attitude toward the black thing  
 ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a "" nigger "" before that person can finish speaking the word  
super  ) 
at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy  
 ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas  ) 
jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of "" the fresh prince of bel-air "" demonstrate  
smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero  
in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off  
smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging  
what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ? 
this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director  
wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic "
-1,"what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ? 
a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? 
if you have an answer , let me know  
foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise  
comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand-up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for  
master p stars as fifty dollah' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin )  
but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's "" idiot plot , "" if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem ) 
so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ? 
not a hell of a lot  
as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write  
he acts like the rapper that he is  
the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro  
as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience  
if you haven't yet figured it out , that is not saying much  
co-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story  
the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand-up and otherwise  
he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips  
he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie  
and indeed , i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here , but from a feature-length movie i expect more  
foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters  
every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry-sporting sibling "" you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush "" ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion "" huh ? "" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife  
believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard-earned $8  
you'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don't have cable  
eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away "

-- yet none of them have been horror films  
 "" sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people  
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this  
i left disappointed  
andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow  "" 
in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors  
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders  
several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman  
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning  
he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret  
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering )  
my reaction : ho-hum  
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting  
that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages  
however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy  
it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal  
along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series  
a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman

just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself'   
'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings  
gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol  
for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end  
this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself  
her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes  
such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house  
this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab  
here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment  
most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party  
the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times  
it is a classic cautionary tale  
an echo  
a big , fat and expensive clich ?  
a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting'

ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious

-1,"synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar  
the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves  
meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession  
comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? 
it's hard to speculate  
most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar  
in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel "" thriller "" ( i use the term "" thriller "" loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad  
the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible  
writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging  
there's really not much to say  
the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience  
most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent  
he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused  
the plot sucks  
nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole  
the dialogue stinks  
a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know  
everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits  
as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being "" assistsant to foley artist  "" 
someone could have used an editor ! 
to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes  
playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here "

-1,"ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark's "" double team "" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career  
actually , in "" double team , "" neither's performance is all that bad  
i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's "" timecop  "" 
and rodman    
well , he's pretty much rodman  
he's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert  
it's the story that needs some major work  
van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park  the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as "" the colony "" -- a think tank for soldiers "" too valuable to kill "" but "" too dangerous to set free  "" 
quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her  
so , what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? 
quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do  
with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks , "" double team "" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure  
but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated  
the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie  
and much of what's going on is just wacky  
there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out  
and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers  
did i mention "" double team "" is strange ? 
when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity "
-1,"this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be "" one of the hottest writers in hollywood ""  
he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7  5/10 ) 
script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series "" dawson's creek ""  
so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said "" sure , go for it ! ""  
uhhm , my question is    did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? 
plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs  tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college  
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman  
critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks  
this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a  fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles  
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr  
zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate  
he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue  
sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs  tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! )  
all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend  
no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater "

-1,"synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library  
when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat  
comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc  etc  ) that have come before it  
malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments  
the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film  
it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this  
melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before  
she drugs someone  
she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment  
and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend  
i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner  
john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student )  
the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald  
at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes  
at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place  
in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches "" f--k you , you b-----d "" and throws a phone  
she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh  
malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either "
-1,"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball  
fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him  
there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind  
the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars  
the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13  
interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey  
instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart  
mission to mars takes it's first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done  
during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife  
it's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety  
the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability  
there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time  
maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects  
it's the year 2020 and this is nasa's first manned excursion to the red planet  
a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results  
graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth  
in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell )  
obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them  
i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them  
time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the crew didn't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable "
-1,"my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free  
as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book  
 ( "" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks  "" ) 
languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending  
since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery  
other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture  
with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host  
he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant  
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project  
surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there  
perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success  
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone  
the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day  
this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible  
sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan )  
after throwing out constant one-liners ( "" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car  "" ) , 
sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket  
and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs  
 ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever  ) 
after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie "
-1,"alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story  
perhaps the musketeer , a new film that "" reimagines "" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many  
it's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences  
this time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can't even pronounce his character's name  
as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu  
he vowed to have vengeance  
after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy  
on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government  
the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal's own guards  
only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie )  
together with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant  
oh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari )  
just thought i'd mention that  
now , look : i don't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing  
i have nothing against "" modernizing "" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects  
director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie  
instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing  
when the musketeers finally get to holler "" all for one , and one for all , "" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt  
maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us  
it's as though anything that may have been construed as "" fun "" was purposely expunged from the production "
-1,"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw )  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan )  
they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano )  
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans  
on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties  
sounds great huh , well it's not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didn't work in this movie ? 
that would be the rest of it "
-1,"adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money  
which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today  
while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash  
it's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making  
but i digress  
sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age  
his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she's leaving him  
by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid  
after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child  
however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn't the real father and wants to take julian back  
koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child  
big daddy really isn't that good  
many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny  
there's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour  
the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous  
the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting  
it's a poor attempt to win over the audience  
adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer  ) 
joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash  
steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny "
-1,"so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again  
that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the "" odd couple "" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's "" grumpy old men , "" 1995's "" grumpier old men , "" and 1997's "" out to sea "" ( i  e  
 "" grumpiest old men "" )  
so , "" the odd couple ii "" ( i  e  
 "" the grumpiest old men of all , really "" ) seems just another entry in a tired series  
the plot is even similar to that of "" grumpy old men "" in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children  
oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car  
  
  
then hilarity ensues  
well , a few chuckles ensue anyway  
neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end  
unlike the original play/movie , "" odd couple ii "" doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters  
instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of "" cybill "" and jean smart of "" designing women "" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert  
the original 1968 movie "" the odd couple "" remains a classic comedy  
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since  
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's "" the fortune cookie "" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , "" the front page "" ( 1974 ) and "" buddy buddy "" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways  
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in "" grumpy old men "" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie "
-1,"the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent  
in other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts  
54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered  
the difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view  
christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark  
he keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists  
the movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot  
he is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur  
he's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs  
myers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling  
at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash  
the story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple  
shades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever  
eventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land  
his looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous  
shane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater  
but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal  
the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent  
54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie  
it's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance "

-1,"i admit it  
i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies  
watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids  
it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation  
and you know they'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa's elves  
he later decks a reindeer  
hey , man , why don't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you're at it ? 
jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought  
arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene  
what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? 
arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son  
he races from the office to his son's karate game , only to find out he missed it  
and his kid distrusts him because he's never around  
 ( gee , we haven't seen that in a movie before  ) 
arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago  
so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out  
let me back up for a minute here -- arnold's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief  
watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin' turboman sheets  
i'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want  
but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don't recognize him until the last minute  
this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory  
most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll "
-1,"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today  
basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers  
how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture  
swordfish is loud , violent and amoral  
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life  
and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? 
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists  
swordfish is a very cynical movie  
it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration  
the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is  
this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions  
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign  
talk about whacked-out patriotism  
my objections to swordfish are many  
the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort  
it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits  
another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife  
stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl  
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films  
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve  
in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed "
-1,"in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , "" boogie nights "" ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station  
when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the "" planet of the apes  "" 
maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr  ( "" cast away "" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d  rosenthal ( "" mighty joe young "" )  
director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake  
davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins  
however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , "" duets "" )  
ari ( helena bonham carter , "" fight club "" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , "" titanic "" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion  
she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual  ' 
general thade ( tim roth , "" lucky numbers "" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race  
he's sweet on ari  
it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes  
the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down  
an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , "" driven "" ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them  
the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie )  
guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying  
the only real success of the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair  
no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work  
roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers "
-1,"a big house  
a big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame  
a big star , catherine zeta-jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6  5/10 ) and zorro  
a big remake of the haunting  
and big special effects  
so what do they all amount to ? 
unfortunately for us , a big bore ! 
plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing  
unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear  
critique : this movie just didn't scare me one bit  
sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us  
well , this film didn't do much for me  
and they might as well have called it the "" haunting of lily taylor "" , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place  
don't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard "" comic relief "" , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension  
neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy  
it's all too sad , cause certainly the "" idea "" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone    poof ! ) and the special effects ? 
well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry  
see it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining

-1,"gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made  
so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? 
first of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive  
also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising  
last of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance  
i mean , the guy can't be that untalented , can he ? 
the answer to that question is three letters long  
nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles  
since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent , it's hard to describe the plot  
let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls  
the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star  
he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans  
this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming  
it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez  
i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft  
he works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes  
halfway through the film , i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation  
then as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions  
it's sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face "" i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do "" attitude  
the performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn't saying much  
at least we don't have to suffer jonathan "" i am the most hideous man in america "" schaech  
we are , however treated to another round of james "" i'm more wooden than keanu "" duval "
-1,"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds  
in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them  
now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die  
they've been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times  
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
it's really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i "
-1," "" soldier "" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting  
the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision  
brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little  
then it goes nowhere with that idea  
there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen  
the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better  
i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting  
between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr  russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited  
his performance in that way isn't all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film  
other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters  
but enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? 
isn't the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? 
even in this aspect the film is a disappointment  
in mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining  
however , he fails to repeat that in this film  
the combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve  
fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize  
but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs  an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s  
if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film  
however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment "
-1,"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture  
even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics  
writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion  
instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way  
no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful  
the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better  
alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio  
and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town  
peeks of sunshine are few and far between  
no wonder the characters are all so miserable  
first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home  
that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi )  
the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other  
claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children  
then charlie re-enters the mix  
so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? 
who cares ? ? 
no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle  
so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time  
they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline  
they should know the ending as well as we do  
and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two "
-1,"well there goes another one  
sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good  
this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite  
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right  
with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date  
here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years  
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up  
he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch )  
so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad  
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any  
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars     as 
long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm  
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs  
even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good "
-1,"saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn't too impressed  
this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama  
sound cliche ? 
that's only the beginning  
billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character  
he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him  
then he goes "" crazy "" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it  
i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting    
but it didn't all come together  
i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle    
but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations  
there was very little logical development in these characters  
my biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible  
they began to resemble g  i  joes , the greatest american hero  
and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls "
-1,"one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles  
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star  
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film  
unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for  
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do  
then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is  
the plot of men with guns can be summarized "" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas  
dr  fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went  
and he found out again and again and again  "" 
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell

but the film talks down to the viewer

he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios

-1,"rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality  
starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko  
running time : 117 minutes 
directed by : christian duguay 
i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career  
he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs  
his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled "" blade ""  
he has had his typical action movies , "" boiling point "" , "" passenger 57 "" , but his new movie "" the art of war "" should just be called "" rising sun 2 : the art of war "" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance  
wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u  n  after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do  
anne archer plays his "" boss "" type person of the u  n  and she has hired snipes to track down the killer  
well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way  
all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie  
wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before  
the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's "" blade ""  
i walked into "" the art of war "" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush  
the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on  
the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock "" the matrix "" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid  
christian duguay's direction is also not that great "
-1,"capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness  
potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring  
claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice  
it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s  f  e  
movie , where s  f  e  
means so f * * * ing earnest  
movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing  
claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk  
claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat  
claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior  
obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk  
the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness  
the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand  
the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively  
 ( ugh ! ) 
the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads  
all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened "
-1,"chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck  
the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr  ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder  
this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius  
that would be pretty nasty  
the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr  richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island  
long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance  
the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops  
upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder  
protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr  ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder  
all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees  
this proves to be tricky  
among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle  
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing  
to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice  
director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie  
when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it  
perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice "
-1,"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller  
though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough  
in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery  
he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny  
he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine  
valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive  
he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997  
seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson  
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party  
he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it  
what a mess  
i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer  
the limey does exactly that  
the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose  
there is no method to this movie's madness  
it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably  
the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving  
this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude  
i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck  
ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant "
-1,"the cartoon is way better  
that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature  
the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic "" home alone "" with puppies , and not much else  
when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be "" why ? 
the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? "" 
the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign  
the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple  
two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight  
they drag their "" human pets "" together , and in a short time both couples marry  
the heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy's new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts  
everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies  
in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities  
we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog's view of humans as their pets  
in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless  
hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks  
while he drew the desired "" aww , they're so cute "" reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering "" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that ? "" 
the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little  
joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles  
in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona  
in "" something wild "" , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor  
in "" terms of endearment "" , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer  
here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film  
glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality "
-1,"when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in "" jackie brown "" , he immediately signed up for a little film called "" american perfekt ""  
this was almost two years ago  
i waited patiently for the film to be released , but it never was  
finally , i forgot about it  
the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , "" american perfekt ""  
i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee , rushed home to view it  
having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release  
 "" american perfekt "" is a jumbled mess  
the storyline is non-existent  
it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on  
and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort  
it wants to get by on quirkyness and so-called charm alone , and it just doesn't work  
robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer , and they head off on the road together  
along the way to no discernable destination , they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters  
i suppose this free-wheeling , no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment , but all it did was make me sleepy  
i'm all for trying new things within the realm of film , but not at the expense of coherence  
nothing in this movie makes sense  
the actions of the characters go unexplained , even when they're truly bizarre

-1,"you don't need to have seen the original "" species "" to appreciate how utterly lousy "" species ii "" is  
with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that "" species ii "" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable  
it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction  
the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle  
the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black  
that should have been the end of the movie right there  
back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate  
on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again "" played "" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing  
this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to "" the dukes of hazzard "" tv show , which she appears to enjoy  
eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk "" mates , "" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only )  
eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on  
peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams "" i told 'em not to go ! "" 
at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle  
michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr  laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns  
they're both unbelievably wooden  
what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( "" the ruling class , "" "" the krays , "" "" let him have it "" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder  
it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like "" species ii  "" 
last year peter hyams gave us "" the relic "" ; no thanks necessary there  
and the first "" species "" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects  
is it just that there are no better offers out there ?

-1,"synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night  
while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter  
comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement  
i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter  
suspense ? 
family drama ? 
humor ? 
erotica ? 
elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them  
instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers  
i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing  
alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter  
her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies  
everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends  
the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds  
the father ( played by j  t  
walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend  
none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music  
the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason  
the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead  
the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes  
incredible ! 
 ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j  d "

i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent "
-1,"depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal  
but in case you didn't know this , don't bother remembering it    
the words "" original sin "" never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it  
the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 )  
regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness )  
boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife  
since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful  
skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills  
original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller  
we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her  
but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money  
girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the "" other man , "" a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place  
add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b  b  gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year  
don't even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal  
just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it's much worse than a sin  
this is sacrilege "
-1," "" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has a lot of bad things in it  
first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation  
the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically  
a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million  
warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid  
this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is "" pokemon : the johto journeys "" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown  
they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities  
the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants  
now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one  
too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between  
it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods  
i'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don't understand what they are saying  
my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was  
his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this    he 
sure did put me in my place  
with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well  
 "" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film  
for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this "
-1,"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70  
mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films  
fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles  
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was  
william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us  
 ( at least in the movies anyway  ) 
it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor  
charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family  
apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling  
so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge  
this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again  
one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood  
fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort  
while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film  
with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes  
one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend  
it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film  
ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original  
roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie  
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way "
-1,"it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch  
take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like  
however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies  
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own  
mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it  
what a crock  
if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for  
why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending  
you're fired  
let's get someone else to do it  
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood  
the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized  
which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize  
in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money  
i miss originality in film , i really do  
i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original  
payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth  
while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman  
there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life  
and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant "
-1,"i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws  
but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american  
or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence  
this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role  
if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work  
although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself  
this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts )  
in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind  
it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail  
it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful  
yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch  
he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison  
his cell , food and rights  all terrible  
now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder  
jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family   
as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered  
red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes  
what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act  
this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption  
but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch "

-1,"the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l  a  confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors  
with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir  
 "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture  
overacted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too  
with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness  
in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc  there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical  
directed by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community  
particularly one  
kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner  
soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house  
next thing , she cries rape  
and the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues  
a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen  
even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer  
he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray  
you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role  
as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie "
-1,"first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given  
for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over  
hopeful still ? 
well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , "" what do you think of my butterfly ? ""  
butterfly ? , 
i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! 
and then it hit me    
the scene had been snipped ! 
damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! 
we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! 
so    
no naked teri hatcher  
forget about that  
okay ? 
now    
heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch )  
everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat  
the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt  
what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues  
when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get  
the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide "
-1,"i love movies  
i really do  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  
then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money  
disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship  
along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin  ' 
'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does  
many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment  
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now  
jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless  
his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives  
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited  
hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture  ' 
way to go liz ! 
for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in  "
-1,"studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film  
are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? 
 "" 54 "" belongs in the elite group of films known as "" the big disappointments "" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished  
i was heavily awaiting "" 54 , "" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this "" edgy "" film  
perhaps more importantly , "" 54 "" is part of the blossoming subgenre , "" the 70s nostalgia film , "" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with "" boogie nights "" and "" the last days of disco "" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from "" boogie nights , "" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from "" the last days of disco , "" not to mention several others  
 "" 54 "" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it  
this is a definite plus  
here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening  
the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people  
but this film doesn't let that happen  
it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess )  
he's dim-witted , into being part of "" the scene , "" and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars    a 
bit like "" saturday night fever , "" 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him  
poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been  
shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from "" clueless "" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame  
although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film  
the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me )  
rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that  
notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails "
-1,"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion  
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner  
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating  
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out  
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following  
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation  
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity  
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e  t  , 
tramps about in the woods  
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants "
-1,"various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
it's all true/three men on a raft ( u  s  a  , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 
a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft  
while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set  
impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians  
sadie thompson ( u  s  a  , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w  somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson ""  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script  
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for  
still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds

-1,"american pie 2 is filled with laughs  
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater  
i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy  
but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself  
what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart  
of the original , i noted it was "" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up  "" 
well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up  
at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser  
fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score  
as usual nothing goes right until the last reel  
but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women  
and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women  
for the most part , they are not shown as individuals  
they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones  
it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program  
despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex  
most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance  
also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians  
it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs  
the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it "
-1,"the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware  
this movie can't make up its mind  
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? 
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? 
either way , "" unbalanced "" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort  
the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years "" getting over "" the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses  
now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it  
with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's  
but when his "" discovery "" becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it  
with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the "" shelmikedmu "" tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe  
despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant  
hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc  in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books  
krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc  thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe  
on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe  
it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner  
sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a "" family comedy "" ) just aren't the right tone for this film  
cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start  
at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs  
doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try  
the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of "" average "" , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them "

-1,"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? 
let me tell you what reality is  
reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot  
that's reality  
america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh )  
the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time  
the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis )  
gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage  
veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all  
 ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab  ) 
and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? 
and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? 
oh billy , you're a scamp ! 
the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? 
and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one  
yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! 
if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine  
it's about to expire  
aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , 
america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself  
i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film  
bad move , billy -- your jokes suck  
the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me  
julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here  
obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise  
none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho  
as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work "
-1," "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary  
that's right  
the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better  
this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic  
his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it  
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising  "" 
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost  
miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people  
it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic  
unlike dustin hoffman's performance in "" rain man "" or leonardo dicaprio's in "" what's eating gilbert grape , "" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting  
however , unlike "" rain man "" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , "" mercury rising "" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid  
hell , he doesn't even have to be shy  
in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm  
willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything  
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide  
of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents  
simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked  
jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon  
this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes "
-1,"michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement  
in about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic "" big game , "" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined  
all that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s  
i can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd  
obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball  
it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam  
out of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000  
instead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend  
reeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely  
the drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs  
and maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game  
one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any  
the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie  
that wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them  
most of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised  
there's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling  
the worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself  
the adults also don't fare well  
reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser  
the character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance "

-1,"fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen  
the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr  nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl  
some shady u  s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard  
and what's more , this beast is heading for new york  
gulp ! 
although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie  
the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies  
broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image  
while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither  
also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting  
she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap  
it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent  
shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film  
hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture  
also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter  
o  k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies  
but what about the script ? 
well , that's not up to par either  
emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script "
-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight )  
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic  
it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir  
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on  
but why ? 
his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  
the kind who just won't die  
hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" )  
they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w  bush's republican national convention speech ( i  e  
bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 
to what end ? "" -- 
this actually got applause ! 
suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd )  
the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 
ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 
as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at )  
they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself "

it's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined  
i felt the same way watching drowning mona  
skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy  
there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing  
there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n  y  , being a test town for the then new yugo  
everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates  
even the police chief drives one  
there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets  
there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred  
it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends  
it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend  
there are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona's tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted  
still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond  
the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler )  
each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more  
there's no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness  
anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is  
the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts "

book of shadows : blair witch 2 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy  
we expect these events  
we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to  
it's part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society  
as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face  
politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong  
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesn't merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
 "" the blair witch project "" was made with a budget of $1  75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real

-1,"synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce  
diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael  
diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people  
comments : the ex is a very bad movie  
i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while  
i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars )  
as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie  
i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000  
the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind )  
those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script  
the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie  
diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime )  
david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger  
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made  
molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son  
time and time again , things do not add up in this movie  
if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex  
if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better  
i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp  
even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful "

neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original

the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance

why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! 
they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens  
yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week  
this "" movie , "" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars  
 "" how can a movie have guest stars ? "" 
you may ask  
well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie  
blade squad is dumb  
blade squad is loud  
blade squad is obnoxious  
blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series  
why not ? 
after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past  
so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? 
to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable  
the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested  
i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it  
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad  
i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11  
and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning )  
but , i digress  
despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series "
-1,"as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable  
with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing  
with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "" the 13th warrior "" will be  
the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead "" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king  
after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog  
so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen  
so far it sounds interesting right ? 
not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes  
after that , they basically run around killing  
that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it  
obviously that's not the case here  
even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed  
since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work  
can't the camera men sit still ? 
i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well  
the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating  
with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs  
that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest  
when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? 
well now i know  
crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement  
what's there to argue about anyway ? 
the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted  
seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see "" the 13th warrior "" become a hit "

starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that  
it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed  
it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time  
why am i calling this movie pornography ? 
pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts  
i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as "" a near-pornographic eternity ""  
i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout "" do 'er , man , do 'er ! "" 
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers  
it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk  
it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening  
the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence  
to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles  
this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome  
 ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too  ) 
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic  
they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense  
they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them  
we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate  
here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? 
hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine  
if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us  
the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be "" screen typist "" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other

wilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from  
the cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order  
she dies , the perps  
escape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge  
sound familiar ? 
unlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee's character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2  by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration  
wearing what appears to be alice cooper's leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner  
but no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman  
 ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though  
 : ) 
a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life  
his two "" best "" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith  
blame said editors for the film's frightful flashbacks , as well "
-1,"the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles  
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update  
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : "" quality "" films ) compete for audiences  
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season  
it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic  
i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment  
are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of "" uniqueness "" betty dolls out is ? 
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material  
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation  
it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it  
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock )  
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities  
she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love  
betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr  david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit  
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime  
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "" average "" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are  
in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim "" boys will be boys ""  
another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! 
what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic  
obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it  
he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience "
-1,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us  
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" 
i'm wondering the same thing  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city  "" 
it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't  
i just didn't  
surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
no , but i expected something  
a funny joke  
a clever prank  
a plot development  
anything  
the movie never delivers  
you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
 "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization  
the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan  
that's it  
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot  
the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington )  
they have a garage band  
they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them  
they have tickets , they lose them "
-1,"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches  
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics  
spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story  
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken  
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films  
_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day  
ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers  
the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france  
there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie  
the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done  
the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat  
another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops  
the technical side of the film is peerless , as always  
the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw  
hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel  
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events  
it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince  
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency )  
for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground  
here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man "
-1,"one of my brother's favorite movies is h  b  halicki's 1974 cult flick "" gone is sixty seconds , "" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's  
chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal  
although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of "" gone in sixty seconds "" is relatively weak and dull  
randall "" memphis "" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track  
he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars  
however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble  
kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week  
calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies  
memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t  j  
cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval )  
as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients  
watching "" gone , "" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one  
maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for "" eleanor , "" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis  
but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait  
i had high hopes for "" gone "" because it is director dominic sena's second film  
 "" kalifornia , "" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience  
in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance "
-1,"how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ? 
in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it  
if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job  
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this ? 
honestly , i'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ? 
truth be known , i don't really think i can answer this question  
to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls  
unless you're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them  
they're a group of five busty british babes who've had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions  
they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra  
all five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names  
there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c  ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b  ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names  
the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame  
it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves  
they don't take themselves too seriously , and that's probably the best thing about them  
it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing  
they're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves )  
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music , while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie  
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  
most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud ! 
if you're a big fan of the group , you probably won't get enough of what you want , and if you're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments  
for the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline "

that's fair enough  
all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt  
the chance to succeed  
after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders  
mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made  
yeah right  
children fail , as do films  
as does director john boorman's latest  
the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport  
though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress  
she's a lightweight  
as the first scene ( with narration ! ) 
demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show  
she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much  
beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory )  
he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets  
why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though  
maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies  
but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations

-1,"i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas  
with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve  
only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it  
the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby ! 
no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release  
i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular  
i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy  
phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10  
nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable  
even the special effects seem rather bland  
the story in this new one is a mindless mess    the 
acting wooden    and the action sequences like something out of a video game

coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount  
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team

-1,"funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways  
the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature  
what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters  
 "" get new jobs ! "" 
was one line , if i remember correctly  
at the end of the 19th century , col  patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda  
he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off  
patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that )  
the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy  
they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature  
give me a break  
the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us  
even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic  
get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up  
he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird  
by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand  
the acting is forgettable  
douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before  
kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography

-1,"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies  
we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting  
since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together  
i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along  
he was not amused  
i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained  
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity  
i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft  
the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque  
this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy  
the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean  
an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect  
in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed  
the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good  
the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets'  
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck  
eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner  
in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet  '

-1,"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review  
because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex ""  
i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review  
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what  
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack  
it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it  
these are things we all do , sometimes  
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts  
their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed  
it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition  
michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say  
his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence ""  
huh ? 
and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get  
the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events  
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy  
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot

he was then fired and rehired two months ago , but by the time he'd left , they had already been contracted to do the film , and bischoff could not play sinclair ( which , in itself , is for the best , as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor ! )  
the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans  
he thinks of them as young , dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real  
that is why he doesn't take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay-per-view  
i have news for you , eric : no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn't for show , unless they are four years old  
this is 2000 , you know , not 1985  
bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy , but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic , rocky-style film ( which it probably should have been  
professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is , why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy ? ) , gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light  
anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows , documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon's double-crossing of bret hart , will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble , that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect  
you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince , but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  
all of these aspects of the film , needless to say , seriously offended me as a wrestling fan  
another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan )  
wouldn't it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair's insistance ? 
i hate that cliche ! 
the world wrestling federation would have made a better film "
-1,"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash  
maybe not ! 
mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether  
tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it  
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l  a  russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts  
stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money  
in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names  
tango & cash is unbearably noisy  
for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes  
to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier  
in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie  
screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv  
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier  
it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie  "" 
the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable "
-1,"ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad  
the review 
jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that  "" 
no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better  
while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns  
this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  
he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  
universal soldier : the return is truly poor  
the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier  
soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers  
considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead  
luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form  
in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program  
working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth  
unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside  
the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg )  
there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  
there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  
luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing  
erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn't leaving without her story ""

there's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl  
in rare cases , the genders are flipped  
predictability is a given  
rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its "" theme "" as an excuse for its plot contrivances  
 "" lightweight "" doesn't begin to describe it  
this is like anti-gravity  
it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy  
jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves  
after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating  
jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed

-1," "" payback , "" brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's "" l  a  confidential "" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it  
mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( "" conspiracy theory "" and "" lethal weapon 4 , "" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead  
porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay  
the tagline for "" payback "" is , "" get ready to root for the bad guy , "" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way  
i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them  
just because the protagonist , a "" bad guy , "" is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will "" root for him , "" and i didn't  
quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings )  
since none of the respectable actors in "" payback "" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out  
lucy alexis liu ( of t  v  's "" ally mcbeal "" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  
meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  
unger , who made an impression in 1997's "" the game , "" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback  
finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later )  
like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking  
in the course of the 102-minute running time of "" payback , "" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer  
and guess what ? 
not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) ,

the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it  
besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film  
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film  "" 
 ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex  ) 
the film began     
the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett  
he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon  
 ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it  ) 
they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him  
brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her  
the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual  
kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't  
the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference  
his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party  
there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity  
kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations "
-1,"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings  
family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail  
still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love  
and after it , i still can't  
bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare  
only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion  
bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children  
dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku )  
over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma  
the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality  
randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening  
his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible  
he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn  
paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well  
as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here  
matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible  
this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it  
modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad  
carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now  
bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie "
-1,"an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'  
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to `ready to rumble'  
judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society  
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny  
unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling     
which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome'

fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher  
not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher  
the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders    you 
get the picture ) don't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers  
this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : "" see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south  "" 
oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before  
but wait ! 
there are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! 
and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not "" cod "" , but "" knights of destruction ""    really ! ) , is none other than    the 
upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! 
so shale does what any good teacher would do  
he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school

-1,"the happy bastard's quick movie review 
the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really  
shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control  
sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber  
since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem  
the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world  
his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground  
then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything  
these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine  
forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while  
however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm  
with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada  
of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish  
this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow  
finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel )  
the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny  
in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? )  
but that's just it- scenes  
there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend  
i mean , was this really necessary ? 
couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? 
i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? 
particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? 
that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad  
the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting "

now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this  
o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company  
he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her

eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever

having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition ""  
the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly  
it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point  
ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster's millions ? ""

-1,"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle  
tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far  
badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves  
i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie  
furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence  
and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production  
of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line  
imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like  
with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse  
anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect  
the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors )  
the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough  
instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a  k  a  john clayton a  k  a  tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march )

inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment  
younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity  
the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle  
all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite  
as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain  
in the cartoon , dr  claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer  
we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat  
as a child , i always imagined what dr  claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years  
with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's    
rupert everett ? ! 
only now , dr  claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' )

-1,"here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy "" bait "" starring jamie foxx and david morse  
this is a review i don't even want to write because i'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it's-beyond-ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff  
if they're not going to give us , the audience , just a little credit and put something together with half a brain , why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it ? 
last summer i took this same approach with my review of "" the mummy , "" in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub-par movies  
i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes ( not all are applicable )  
i hope this goes to show you what i think of "" bait "" and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess  
it's genuinely unfunny ( i , and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours ) , unoriginal and unthrilling  
it's not so bad to the point where it's fun to watch because of its badness and it's no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it , it's just such a cliche in and of itself , that , uhh    
lost my train of thought  
anyways , here's those quotes , enjoy ! 
 "" getting an audience's attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how today's films work  
we want to have something exciting to watch , not a slow build-up of a story ( god forbid ! ) , and this film plays right into the mainstream's hands    "" 
- review of "" armageddon  "" 
 "" it's clear the film doesn't want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability ( the most minimal amount necessary ) comes across as a half-assed effort  
supporting characters and shady sup-plots are introduced , but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters , only a handful have any real significance    
there's a fine line separating homage from plagiarism "
-1,"in the finale of disney's "" mighty joe young , "" a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground  
upon impact , rugged everyman and perennial do-gooder bill paxton rushes in , containing the emotional crowd with an earnest "" move along now folks , there's nothing to see here  "" 
ok , so those aren't exactly the words he uses , but it's probably one of the few clich ? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies , "" king kong  "" 
1949's "" mighty joe young "" was an update of that classic creature feature , also based on merian c  cooper's original story ( 16 years after "" 'kong "" it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable )  
now some 49 years later , at least according to disney's way of thinking , the world is ready for one more  
not so  
the only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects  
and these , unfortunately , run hot and cold  
today's joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker , who has been wowing audiences with his state-of-the-art make-up effects since 1971's "" schlock "" ( which , incidentally , featured a baker-enhanced "" gorilla "" )  
joe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit  
while there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker's had a lot of practice with simian effects , after all , including "" gorillas in the mist , "" "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes , "" and the 1976 remake of "" king kong "" --there's also some surprising cheesiness  
one of the film's most embarrassing moments is when paxton's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from "" the lost world : jurassic park "" )  
paxton jubilantly extols the beast's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt  
also , if the film's producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn't have paraded female lead charlize theron ( "" trial & error "" ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrobe of spaghetti-strapped tops  
even joe seems distracted at times  
the film piles on the clich ? s like there's no tomorrow , including the predictable plot ( anthro-zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l  a  where urban havoc is inevitably wrought ) , predictable villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace ) , predictable love story ( bill and charlize--surprise ! ) , and predictable denouement ( "" 'twas box-office receipts that killed the beast "" )  
kids raised on "" men in black "" ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( "" tremors "" ) underwood's outing a little lame by comparison "

-1,"this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film  
no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story  
however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , "" the prince of egypt "" remains shallow  
but i'll begin from the beginning  
the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero  
maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence  
there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing  
most of all , though , the story's focus has shifted  
rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , "" the prince of egypt "" is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses  
i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin  
rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it    
 * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled )  
but enough about the differences  
let's talk about the movie itself  
it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn't convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is  
it features a cookie-cutter "" i-wanna-please-dada "" rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things )  
the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the "" new-improved "" miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice )  
speaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music "
-1,"robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style  
overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber )  
so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble  
jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically "" uplifting "" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it  
williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii  
one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment  
jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast  
the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant "" heil hitler ! "" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto  
liberation ! he thinks  
the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along  
soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death  
this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate  
the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger  
in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home  
apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear  
he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning  
the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine  
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false  
such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope  
that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false "
-1," "" knock off "" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie  
it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year  
i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found  
jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods  
rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays    
actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be  
she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there  
many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick  
where chan comes off as endearing in his "" normal guy "" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp  
we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions  
to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear  
the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong  
tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , "" double team "" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration  
we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe  
fabulous ! 
seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away  
for example , look at sam raimi  
 "" army of darkness "" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story  
that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp "
-1,"8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery  
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs  christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe  
the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed  
all mrs  christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not  
welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide  
although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most  
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away  
8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller  
the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage  
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998  ) 
here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice  
and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up  
only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent  
his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch  
catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves  
her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year  
also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director  
as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch "
-1,"teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood  
every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand  
the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal  
you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span  
the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due  
that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash  
josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times  
she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office  
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life  
there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media  
so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation  
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c  reilly )  
the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter  
however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field  
obviously , the field assignment involves a high school  
specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them  "" 
i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t  
the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school  
interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again "

it's a movie about a big snake that eats people  
that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more  
instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too  
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river  
led by anthropologists dr  steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives  
along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda  
to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is  
at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing  
cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help  
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake  
however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle  
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid  
in this movie , they're both  
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for  
you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else  
or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else  
at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake "
-1,"when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u  s  until late august  
happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater  
unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory  
worse , actually  
fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read "" laura palmer's secret diary  "" 
for "" twin peaks "" junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved  
the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish  
the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon  
the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper  
lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later  
ah , twin peaks : "" familiar territory , "" you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in  
wrong ! 
the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't  
only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos  
the rest of the "" twin peaks "" cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town  
cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna  
the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth  
the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence  
we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere "

neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? 
ok ! 
yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes  
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however  
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie  
but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises  
we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making  
guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts  
right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce "" mr  lombardo ""  
the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done  
on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day  
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations  
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor  
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray  
yes , that bill murray ! 
sound like a good , complete movie ? 
yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning  
in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film  
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time  
by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable  
unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about  
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been "

with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , "" twilight "" would seem very promising  
however , the script is tired and predictable  
it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role  
the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia  
 "" twilight "" wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell  
all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p  i  
among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation  
the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998  
elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir  
the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script

the result should have been more interesting than "" the cell  "" 
as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained  
after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report  
meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim  
his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them  
he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning  
although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast  
not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma  
from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction  
to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking  
so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time

now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel  
the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either  
fast forward to the late '80's  
steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years )  
nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role  
that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter  
the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original  
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets  
it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets  
the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's

-1,"for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess  
in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman  
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place  
france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england  
there was no strong political leadership in the country  
morale was low , there being little hope for the future  
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions  "" 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him  
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown  
he does    
and she does  
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors  
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material  
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable  
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role  
ms  jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse  
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant "

 "" i'm married ! "" 
if jonathan lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film  
instead , its failings go much deeper  
first off , who hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ? 
if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a "" comedy "" which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in  
who's next ? 
jack nicholson and martin short ? 
it certainly doesn't have to be funny  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive  
offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete  
that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with  
when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as "" barbecue , "" it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects  
rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who's married to matthew perry's none-too-successful dentist  
it's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust  
then there's natasha henstridge ( "" species "" i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis  
she gets involved with perry's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door  
henstridge and perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together  
perry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up  
most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants "
-1,"talk about beating a dead horse ! 
when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film  
the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited  
for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber  
now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the "" home alone "" name as well  
the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3  
by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest  
the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d  linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness  
he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was  
the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber  
in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls  
this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip  
instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school  
his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day  
through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u  s  air force integrated circuit comes into his possession  
it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it  
the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains

a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell

-1,"in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere  
but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii  
in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality  
very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert  
whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible  
the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond  
the movie is set in 2018  
for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child  
jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border  
sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed  
although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence  
jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape  
such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen  
after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity  
the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable  
by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too  
of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society  
the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors  
lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia  
kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance "

in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character  
living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other  
this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant  
24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine "" frame  "" 
although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy )  
for her to do photos for "" frame , "" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her  
lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson  
the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin  
this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture  
syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club  
lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother  
lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being "" pigeonholed , "" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses  
a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical  
that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny  
 "" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , "" is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine  
when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , "" i want to get high with you  "" 
in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand

comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers  
technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles  
 ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi  ) 
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isn't a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
they're awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio ! 
what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn  
 "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself  
 "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix ! "" 
unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book

the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there

it needs characters for empathy value

his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience

don't accept the charges  
do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up'  
i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so  
the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes'  
meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease  
while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery  
`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests  
for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development  
this is an annoying and ineffective device  
cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems  
if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story  
granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film  
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck

we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career

i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that  
sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid  
at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me  
despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up  
so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? )  
i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr  magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well  
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness  
as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen

we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty  ? 
then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ?

-1," "" spawn "" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster  
it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them  
in a classic example of telling and not showing , "" spawn "" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how "" men are the ones who create evil on earth  "" 
so much for a message  
the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant  
simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin )  
of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d  b  
sweeney )  
his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's  
clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn  
wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that "" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash  "" 
phew  got all that ? 
it would be easy to dismiss "" spawn "" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level  
the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated  
the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks  
other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image  
in movies like "" contact , "" the special effects serve the story  
in "" spawn , "" they are the story  
and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character "
-1,"an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london  
where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms  
where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny  
in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity )  
the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping  
soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all  
she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache )  
serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out  
however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't  
she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself  
actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie  
she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate  
this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience  
delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her  
delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise  
she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both  
given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives  
it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss  
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts  
the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay "
-1,"i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder  
i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power "
-1,"warner brothers has scored another marketing coup  
the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever  
trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel  
carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11  99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy  
ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment  
he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome  
the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon  
 ( you can guess what happens to mr  paws  
hint : it sounds like splat  ) 
the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat  
with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes  
the rest of the film is just more of the same  
sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? 
writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups  
instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny  
the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see  
though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten  
the script is virtually devoid of wit  
tribal mask jokes ? 
jerry lewis cameos ? 
forget it "

she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years , and that lara holds the key to time , well , needless to say , they want to nab it from her  
oh yeah , lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts    hummana-hummana-hummana    
critique : angelina jolie was great in this movie  
there were also about three "" action scenes "" that were pretty cool to look at in this film  
uhhhhhm , unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked ! 
bad dialogue , generic sidekicks and bad guys , a lame mystery , yoda-esque moments with mumbo-jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end  
all in all , this movie wasn't the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about , especially since every other scene does feature jolie's torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts , but it was quite the letdown nonetheless , especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool , hip woman hero , based on a popular video game  
i don't know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who didn't really tie the whole movie together all that well  
the film lacked energy , a consistent pace and well    a

-1,"what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project  
most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films  
john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin  
screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd  
ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes  
even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules  
when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining  
after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration  
the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining  
the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are  
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights  
we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar  
the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun  
reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest  
evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! "" 
and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments  
the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain )  
nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person  
when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays  
unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship  
thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard "
-1,"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger  
he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck  
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art )  
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" )  
of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind    of 
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people  
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't  
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" )  
but this one has a special place in my heart  
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it  
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000  "" 
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine  
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land  
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off "
-1,"several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes  
this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio  
there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script  
the premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest  
edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries  
along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair  
the explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall  
this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs  
farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it  
matthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast  
as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man  
i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together  
as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression  
eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla  
frankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman  
although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution  
the special effects , such as they are , are execrable  
for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle  
even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes  
while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric "
-1,"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality  
like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies  
consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe  
let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset  
the best word to describe this film is "" asinine  "" 
the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty  
krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules  
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist  
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two  
finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work  
once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college  
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished  
shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own  
now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings  
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu ""  
to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb  
soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon  
but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud  
the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt  
unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this "
-1,"jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun  
his latest film , "" knock off , "" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless  
you can't really blame van damme  
no one , i suspect , has ever expected "" the muscles from brussels "" to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray  
and even his sidekick co-star , "" saturday night live "" alumnus rob "" makin' copies "" schneider , does what's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man  
no , the problem with the film is its direction  
the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible    
and it goes downhill from there ! 
five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes  
van damme doesn't land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess  
director hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed "" double team , "" films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard to know what's going on , who's on whose side , and what the point of all this is  
faster than you can yell "" fruit stand ! "" 
we're watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme  
when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing "" move your beautiful big ass , "" the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre  
every now and again "" knock off "" will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they're wasted  
if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute  
if you're interested in the plot , you're better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : "" jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with "" nanobombs "" hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs

-1,"i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it  
however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i  e  
i didn't like it  
if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal  
that's the kernel of it , anyway  
tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship  
unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace  
actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was  
they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones  
they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction  
three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town  
one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives  
in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be  
he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones  
even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him  
anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character  
we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland  
as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague  
and then there's the special effects "

-1,"there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book "" screenwriting made easy  "" 
this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film  
it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters  
yes , "" the poseidon adventure "" is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters  
and "" earthquake , "" my god ! 
 "" earthquake "" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold

it's in , dare i say it ?

they're just stupid  
and the actors are all good ones  
tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer )  
anne heche is a good indy actress  
don cheadle stole the disappointing "" devil in a blue dress "" from denzel's feet  
and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors

unfortunately , to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set-up , loads of tedious filler , interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching , a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia's career  
if ever a movie screamed "" wait for video so you can fast-forward through all the dull and annoying parts , "" this is it  
eddie murphy plays g , a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message  
a chance meeting with ricky hayman ( goldblum ) , a stressed-out executive of a home-shopping channel , and kate newell ( kelly preston ) , a no-nonsense media analyst , results in physical injury to g  quicker than you can say "" the odd couple , "" g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky  
after some script gymnastics , g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network , wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations , enraging network owner mr  mcbainbridge ( loggia ) , and becoming a national media sensation  
 "" holy man "" attempts to be several things at once  
it tries to satirize home shopping networks , but it's difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self-parody  
the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts , but that's common knowledge already  
 "" holy man "" also tries to present a story of redemption , as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g's good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career  
anyone want to place a wager on his final decision ? 
the one genuine asset in "" holy man "" is eddie murphy , who gives a charming performance , sharing love , good will and relevant advice to all those around him , while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments  
murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he's onscreen  
unfortunately , he's not onscreen enough  
jeff goldblum gets the lion's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down  
as his potential love interest , kelly preston tries to brighten things up , but she transforms from an all-business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance  
the other principal actor , robert loggia , wastes his talents in a one-note turn as a ruthless , screaming monster  
structurally unsound and way too long , "" holy man "" is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isn't

down periscope stars kelsey "" frasier "" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy  
like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on

after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone

and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  
first they're singing "" louie louie "" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off  
the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too )  
it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it  
the jokes are right out of "" mchale's navy "" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past  
there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , "" this expired in 1966 ! "" 
i yelled back at the screen , "" so did these jokes  "" 
i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it  
my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will  
the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though  
kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with  
his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had "" welcome aboard "" tatooed on his penis  
grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about  
same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous "
-1,"wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple  
it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit  
ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell  
basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of "" the storm of the century  "" 
how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? 
not nearly enough  
so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous  
audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel  
the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters  
i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale  
based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak  
using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality  
right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c  reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne )  
so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer  
it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal  
allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines ! 
are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? 
fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be  
the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene "" you know what would look good on you ? 
me ! "" 
ooooh real creative )  
as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human  
only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk  
the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real "
-1,"when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment  
even politicians ( ! ) 
tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction  
these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be  
thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation  
similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess  
the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world  
12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie  
meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow  
pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core  
it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for  
so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather  
pay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ?  
hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? "" 
leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment  
 ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all )  
these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings  
while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience  
it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns  
one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip  
spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance  
maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference "
-1,"young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn't stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time  
in the u  s  , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under  
personally , i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb  
young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts  
his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo  
the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth  
whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island  
in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar  
yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity  
although yahoo's performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2  
yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever  
but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy  
young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot  
yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing  
almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video  
the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the "" 1812 overture "" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect  
halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker  
but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms "
-1,"as bad as "" mimic "" was , it definitly scared me  
 "" mimic "" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie  
director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film "" cronos  "" 
that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie  
in "" mimic "" , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original  
the plot is a stupid combination of "" aliens "" meets "" species "" meets "" jurassic park  "" 
the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies  
there's nothing new in "" mimic ""  
it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work  
at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back  
maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on  
i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the "" seven "" trend and be set in dark , dank areas  
watching "" mimic "" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen "" turn the lights on ! 
the switch is to your right ! 
use common sense ! 
just do it ! 
you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "" 
there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off  
it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts  
 "" hmmm     
i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight  "" 
 "" mimic "" has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! 
just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you "
-1,"there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director  
of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog , "" and 1987's underrated , "" prince of darkness  "" 
heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness  "" 
but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man  "" 
somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , "" village of the damned , "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , "" escape from l  a  "" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter's vampires  "" 
if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title  
it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires  "" 
the story is simple  
jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith )  
since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her  
it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him  
my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? 
well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made  
 "" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen  
in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time  
the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's  
and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent  
there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters  
james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue "
-1,"i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream  "" 
maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the "" scream "" flicks as well as the "" i know what you did last summer "" soon to be flicks  
it owes less to "" halloween "" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of "" the stepford wives , "" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
 "" behavior , "" starring katie holmes of "" dawson's creek , "" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suck-ups  
preppies  
it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like "" beautiful girls "" and "" things to do in denver when you're dead "" ( as well as "" con air "" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as "" the movies with potential that blow it  "" 
i remember a film called "" white man's burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise  
here's another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesn't  
it's too sloppy and too contrived "
-1,"inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price  
directed by william malone  
starring geoffrey rush , famke janssen , and chris kattan  
rated r ( contains violence , profanity , and brief nudity )  
synopsis : eccentric millionaire price offers $1 , 000 , 000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium  
the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment , an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients  
comments : house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price  
in an obvious homage , the millionaire's name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have  
this is a pretty bad horror film , yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining , and house on haunted hill is just such a film  
it is , surprisingly , better than another recent haunted house remake , the haunting , a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson  
the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face  
house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b-movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it's a crappy horror movie  
thus , somehow , it proves slightly more successful  
i can't think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast  
it is this cast which lifts this ho-hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror  
price , the main character , is played by geoffrey rush , the academy-award winning actor of shine  
rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry , a spiral reminiscent of ben ( ghandi , schindler's list ) kingsley's ridiculous appearance in the camp sci-fi classic species  
i don't know why , but sometimes it's entertaining to see "" quality "" actors in bad movies  
more surprises ? 
rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure ( rather lamely too ) , and singer lisa loeb ( ! ) 
appears as a tv news reporter  
the highlight of the cast , however , has to be saturday night live member chris kattan "
-1,"a friend invites you to a movie  
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality  
the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city  
they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over  
romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance )  
it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood  
you accept  
you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_  
but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned  
alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_  
oh , woe  
your hope has sunk  
why was this movie made ? 
why was it released ? 
it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved  
at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem  
but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers  
_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife )  
birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume  
what is the point of this ? 
does it make any sense ? 
is it supposed to be funny ? 
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child  
all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none  
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion "
-1,"starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that  
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman  
these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins  
so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins  
so much for hopes  
schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy  
unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding  
still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse  
so , dr  hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug  
their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman  
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 
well , it must have to the producers of junior  
admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off  
perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny  
but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best  
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny  
schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics  
i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture  
better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? 
anything would have been better than this mess  
danny devito is wasted in this movie "

also , sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners  
there are some good performances , as usual , from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles  
charles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes  
his part is mildly amusing  
richard o'callaghan is appealing as bogg's stuck-up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg's assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha  
however , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer  
although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character  
a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress  
the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope  
in his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny  
joan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor )  
sims' 'usual' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques

-1,"i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series  
if there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon  
this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original  
but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad  
you see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection  
but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ? 
that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad  
i've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much  
it has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access  
obviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen )  
the three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi  
of the three , only danes has a real character  
ribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes  
when the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations  
all kinds of good stuff ! 
the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments  
although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance  
epps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity  
but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting  
a drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful  
claire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained  
she could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role "
-1," "" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , "" 
screams the television ads for "" hanging up , "" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton  
make me laugh again ! 
not only is "" hanging up "" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes  
and we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? 
excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion  
eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james )  
her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him )  
while eve's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up's and down's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic  
her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress  
interestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them  
maddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another  
and they talk  
and talk  
and talk    
in fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long  
if you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest  
the question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? 
how could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? 
issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought  
also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes  
and when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children  
you can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other "

john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes  
for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make  
ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace  
in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue  
this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness  
it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way  
but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience  
ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176  
mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget )  
it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film  
society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little  
apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control  
and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things  
society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten  
the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony  
instead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson , this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams "
-1,"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros  , have never generated much interest at the box office  
but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well  
with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy  
it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most'  
and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video  
in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity  
the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation  
mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition  
despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth  
outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel  
earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces  
it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie  
it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story  
this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more  
they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act  
this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana  
the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best  
they spoke little , but fought a lot  
thus , the movie was easy to digest "

-1,"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel  
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream  
and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it  
the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects  
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons  
i also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania  
at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene  
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech  
however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive  
off the high board  
suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball  
up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk  
if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical  
but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs  midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film  
indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces  
this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas  
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it  
and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare  
at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' 
then i realized he was , and i was watching it "
-1,"this is the worst movie i've seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way ""  
it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap  
it is crap through and through  
nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" )  
here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement  
but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre  
not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again  
there is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring  
they set up mr  freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners  
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death  
but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines  
as mr  freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass  
personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable  
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin ""  
apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold

yup , it's gotta be summer  
just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed  
the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff  
sound exciting ? 
dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing  
 ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! 
calling dean edell    ) 
so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny  
 ( oddly , no one thinks to just    
jump off the back of the boat  ) 
with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- 
the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated  
 ( what are the odds ? ) 
they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! )  
 ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? 
wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) 
bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests  
 ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor  
 ( his first lol line is to ms  bullock : "" i'd like to boogie with you  "" ) 
of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does  
he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards "
-1," * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * 
cast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes 
the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but  
gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away  
don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot  
when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining  
what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected )  
before i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr  pepper  
every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it  
little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products  
dr  pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face  
these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film  
clich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars  
dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day )  
films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that )  
there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper "" u'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it  
this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on )  
scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating  
ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing  
his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes "
-1,"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been  
the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets  
to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews  
jakob , however , never stops moving  
it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset  
he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision  
the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior  
after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near  
when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto  
the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes  
a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive  
this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams  
i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year  
compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material )  
jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them  
when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky  
oh yes , and then there's that little girl  
some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar  
they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships  
jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina "

reviewed by dennis schwartz 
a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher  
the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects  
the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat , so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain , almost as valued a commodity  
that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them  
this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet  
it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future  
an ex-circus clown named louison ( dominique pinon ) , the film's too-good-to-be-true hero , answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet ( jean-claude dreyfus ) , and the butcher and landlord , offers him room and board in his house  
the butcher's clumsy and near-sighted daughter julie ( marie-laure dougnac ) falls in love with the skinny , weird looking clown , and the two make some music together , with her playing the cello and him a saw  
they are the innocents , surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father , who has lured into his tenement the clown , as he has his past innocent victims , so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat , which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement  
the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other  
there are two youngsters ( boban janevski & mikael todde ) who do any kind of mischief they can  
a frog man ( howard vernon ) who lives with water on the floor so he can raise his frogs and snails that he eats  
two brothers ( mathou & kube ) who create little cow-moo novelty toys  
a man ( holgado ) who sells a bullshit detector to the butcher for his piece of meat  
a slutty woman ( karin viard ) , who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat  
the aristocratic woman ( silvie laguna ) who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right  
the tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they know what the butcher is up to , so they are forced to communicate with each other through a pipe that runs through the building ( in one scene they are all in musical harmony to the lovemaking of the butcher and his gal , as their bedsprings squeak )  
there is also a sex-crazed postman ( chick ortega ) , who lusts for the butcher's daughter and carries a gun while delivering the mail  
there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics , called trogolodistes , who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain  
the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics , as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity "

i must have , because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment  
here's the plot  
ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network , one of those 24-hour home shopping channels  
the new boss ( robert loggia ) plans to can ricky's behind if he doesn't turn the previous months' flat sales numbers around , and to add to his problems , ricky also has to work with kate ( kelly preston ) , the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him  
kate and ricky don't get along and don't have any great ideas until they meet g ( eddie murphy ) , a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything  
his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good , and it's this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network's success  
the first problem is a flaw in the plot  
sure , g makes people feel good  
sure , we're told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item , no matter how wealthy they might be , and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought  
but , hey , that's after they've bought it  
why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera ? 
far from trying to sell the product , g instead blathers on about how you don't even need the thing  
someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place  
you might say that people feel good about what they've bought , so they come back and by more , but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable , i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind  
the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible  
another problem is in the humor  
you know , if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie , i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy  
whoa , partner , are you in for a surprise  
holy man is not funny  
murphy , the one asset you'd think this movie has ( remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense ? 
- then again , maybe you don't ) is seriously reigned in  
the script gives him almost nothing to work with , and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn't be left as window dressing "
-1,"if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer's biggest pleasures  
if only  
in fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one  
take the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff  
after being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead  
but suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he's only injured  
a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it  
did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ? 
apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone  
do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ? 
having said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits  
the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr  evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power's "" mojo "" ( don't you just love that word ? ) 
whilst he is cryogenically frozen  
when austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley's vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham  
this sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me  
then there's mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a    
petite clone of myer's dr  evil , exactly 1/8 in size  
troyer's persona alone gains the film an extra half-star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini-mr

-1,"plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions  
i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise  
there are certain genres that just don't go together  
the film opens with a sequence that i still don't understand  
it involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten  
in any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living  
they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america  
their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier  
his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name "" gentleman highwaymen  "" 
lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career  
he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals  
meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic travails  
director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera  
most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going on  
the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity  
instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits  
he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut  
the weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters  
the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic  
when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film "

be forewarned  
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species  
squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't )

so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid  
the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can  
in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna  
patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring  
and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction  
species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around  
however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered  
mr  brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches  
like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious  
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here  "" 
this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful  "" 
and she's not even empathic ! 
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he's going to rape her  "" 
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own "

and what a strange career path for director chuck russell  
he starts his career off with a decent take on the "" nightmare on elm street "" series with his debut as director on installment number three  
he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that  
so then he thought , "" let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes "" ? ! ? 
strange dude and one crappy flick  
plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god  
a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl's aunt wants to    well , 
save her from those damn devil worshippers !

what's good about this movie ? 
well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around  
the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much  
and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film's entire basis of believability  
for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes    is 
a dumb one ! 
add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? 
at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you've got yourself a pretty bad movie "

usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e  , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives  )

they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur  ) 
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller ? 
they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) 
harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck )  
once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic  
 "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue

christopher lambert vs  evil ninjas in modern-day japan    
and nobody wins  
the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it  
i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting  
christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan  
he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone )  
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered  
since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die  
let's stop and think about this for a second  
if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock  
in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him  
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body  
you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is  
this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems  
lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun  
they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows "

-1,"america's favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in "" bride of chucky , "" and their unholy matrimony is something old , nothing new  
the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers , however , has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up , but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked honeymoon  
the answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber ( or at least singe it ) lovin'  
guess they're anatomically correct  
chucky ( again voiced by brad dourif ) , of course , is the star of the "" child's play "" series , a my buddy-type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer  
in "" bride , "" the plot ( heh ) picks up with his girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) resurrecting chucky's remains ( he was blown up at the end of "" child's play 3 "" ) with the help of a black arts manual called "" voodoo for dummies  "" 
silly mortal  
before long , she's also been reduced to shin-high figurine status , and the plastic incarnations of these one-time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies  
the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple ( nick stabile and katherine heigl ) with conjugal plans of their own , leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical , soul-transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait  
along the way , our murderous barbie and ken go through post-marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds - bicker , argue , kiss and make up  
but when they squabble over who's going to do the dishes , watch out  
hey , even faux people have got to work through their problems  
director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two , but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing  
when one of them charges , it's nothing a good forward punt couldn't take care of  
and when a climactic chase scene is needed , one of the dim-bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint  
throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending ( will "" son of chucky "" be next ? ) and this is a bizarrely bad 89-minutes at the movies  
as is the thing to do in post- "" scream "" slasher cinema , don mancini's screenplay slathers on the in-jokes and genre-parody  
but little of the humor succeeds , proving self-reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite  
to be fair , though , most of "" bride of chucky "" is on auto-pilot , so it's not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film  
similarly shaky , the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland , the effects aren't that special and the story is one big groaner "

i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head  
get some perspective  
even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes  
i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery  
michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago  
the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr  evil  
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture  
powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with  
the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with  
the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props    
the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions  
one is dr  evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for )  
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever

it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about  
it's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer  
she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs  
the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet  
she now wants her own identity and her independence  
the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie  
the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax  
it's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni  
she later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel  
alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni

she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni

using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget  
this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre )  
now , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller  
catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery )  
if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes  
the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre  
the result is that the entire production feels contrived  
i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones  
now while this may be a compliment for ms  zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are  
just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between "" entrapment "" and "" blackmail ""  
with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x  
well , you'd be wrong  
the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular  
unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years  
the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists  
many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing  
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask  
nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? 
i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) "

his shtick was marked by crassness  
in this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , "" maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex  "" 
this kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature  
 "" dirty work "" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically  
emotionally , they've never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback  
although having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people

mitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation  
their idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they'll do your dirty work  
in the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot  
their presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge  
by default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material  
except for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call  
already weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction  
but what's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor

-1,"the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing  
however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel  
and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead  
the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is  
if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience  
of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an "" r "" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies  
there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring  
this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment  
somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as "" erotic  "" 
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism  
sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions  
anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater  
i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly )  
although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone  
this creature , dubbed "" eve "" by its creator , dr  laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile  
meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars  
a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them  
ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session  
his intention is obviously world domination "
-1,"i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's "" the company of wolves , "" to 1992's "" the crying game , "" and 1994's "" interview with a vampire  "" 
his latest film , "" the butcher boy , "" is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming  
told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life  
his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore  
francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder  
the premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works  
francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him  
this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well  
the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay  
the supporting characters are no help , though  
rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter  
he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout  
shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her  
and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice  
the pacing is all off in , "" the butcher boy  "" 
although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while  
it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs  
at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it  
i'd rather think of , "" the butcher boy , "" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire  
he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film "
-1,"my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release )  
i didn't see the first film until much later  
so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it  
watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever  
you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before  
this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story  
plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless  
and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ? 
don't get me wrong though    
it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics  
most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is  
horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it  
a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video  
it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set  
the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided )  
the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5  1 mix  
also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography "
-1," "" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? "" 
obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released "" urban legends : final cut ""  
this is another "" scream "" -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time  
amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do  
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines  
soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one  
is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! 
a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? 
this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting  
it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain  
the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly  
in fact watching films like that after having watched "" scary movie "" is impossible keeping a serious face  
several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding  
and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing  
it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century  
how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? 
it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them  
they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence  
however , director john ottman manages to make "" urban legends : final cut "" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre  
what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in "" scream "" , ottman takes seriously  
for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be  
it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect  
even movies like "" lost in space "" and "" mission to mars "" seem spectacular in its shadow  
we have not seen such waste of t !

-1," "" goodbye , lover "" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why  
it's a mess  
and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up  
the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters  
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment  
i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to )  
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair  
either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist  
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid  
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy  "" 
and that's one of her wittier asides  
degeneres' sgt  
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of    wait

sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a "" creative yet unfocused "" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney  
sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help

-1,"capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension  
alien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen  
it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her  
in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp  
a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning  
at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home  
unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod  
the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent  
ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not  
the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against  
lice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch )  
at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way  
one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck  
worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated  
what's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc  sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack  
the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s  dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it  
in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie  
it's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it "
-1,"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one  
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup  
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out  
somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them  
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned  
sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create  
with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , 
something this bad can't help but look even worse  
the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received  
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon  
science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel  
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness  
but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful  
this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect

-1,"as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things  
i am befuddled by fight club  
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later  
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time  
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them  
fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former  
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold  
but if it is , i sure don ? t see it

once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally  
they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days  
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table  
but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ?

-1,"one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself  
such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch  
made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan  
kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract  
but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion  
the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair  
cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship  
during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her  
after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping  
she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms  
apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms  lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father  
despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray  
jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos  
the actors aren't good either  
julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him  
bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend  
sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film  
the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion  
one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke "

bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
still haven't got the point ? 
other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly , this movie deserves a

so i'm giving it a

right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film

and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws  
outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g  robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor )  
delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james  
alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch  
the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended  
but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads  
the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people  
along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live  
they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background  
the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card  
the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell  
after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds  
and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal

-1,"one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles  
at least one would hope so  
one would be seriously incorrect  
eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more  
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence  
ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer  
using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life  
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate  
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization  
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital  
sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor  
the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help  
on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood  
after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment  
an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he "" fixes "" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work  
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else

the film disproves that assumption  
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen

-1,"synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court  
after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie  
comments : "" alan smithee "" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled "" fatal bore "" or "" fatal crap ""  
if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by "" alan smithee , "" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else  
 "" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad  
frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the "" alan smithee "" moniker for this film  
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? 
let's start with the acting  
it's pretty bad  
amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material  
she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete  
her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke  
the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand  
christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm  
trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket  
if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here  
early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom  
outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film  
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever  
fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills  
the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with "
-1,"the previews for the movie are pretty good  
they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script  
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes  
the residents of mystery love hockey  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football  
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes  ) 
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch  
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated  
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz  
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl  
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad  
on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition  
on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes  
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition  
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement  
he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife  
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding  
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth  
his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater "

-1,"the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters  
director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth  
what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm  
john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell )  
brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods )  
soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who  
ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story  
perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something  
on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed  
the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and "" shocking "" plot developments  
having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree  
scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines  
 ( sunderland actually asks brenner , "" why was she killed ? "" 
to which i would have answered , "" if i knew , then the movie would already be over  "" ) 
only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored  
not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot  
in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask  
she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring  
instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap  
this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience  
it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise "
-1,"play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways  
like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots  
shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story  
shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions  
play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse  
the film has no social message like its predecessors  
the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons  
the whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other  
unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below  
1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet  
the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory  
2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas  
there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something  
3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way  
she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other  
4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories  
vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner  
these boring tales only hurt the central plot  
5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other  
wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? 
by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over "
-1,"robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects  
he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her  
they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash  
just when it couldn't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr  ) 
annie can't take the grief anymore , and kills herself  
 ( all sounding like good fun so far ? ) 
the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow  ) 
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar  
this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made  
everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters  
williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face  
there's no emotion behind it  
sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film  
she may look pretty , but she can't act  
max von sydow is o  k as the traveller , if nothing special  
cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film  
it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement  
all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground  
there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers

playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one  
congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing  
some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed  
then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet  
harsh ? maybe  
justified ? 
hell yes ! 
this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes  
for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away  
this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look ! 
john woo ! 
two guns blazing ! 
slooooow motion ! "" 
and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie  
poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better  
unlike most movies this one does not suffer from "" stupid bad guy "" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes  
example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages  
now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero  
 ( term used as loosely as possible ) 
survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds  
even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger  
mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not  
some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! 
two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second  
solution ? 
boom ! 
i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much  
another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : 
our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her  
he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers "
-1,"in "" the astronaut's wife , "" charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly  
if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : "" rosemary's species  "" 
what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in "" the devil's advocate "" - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory  
ok , maybe "" the astronaut's wife "" deviates from "" rosemary's baby "" turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man  
predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great "" bowfinger "" line about "" alien love  "" 
theron's "" advocate "" character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly  
 "" astronaut "" provides only artificial anxiety  
last year's equally noodle-headed "" species ii "" spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage  
 "" the astronaut's wife "" is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far  
here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from "" the abyss "" and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in "" big daddy  "" 
draw your own conclusions  
director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary "" e  t  "" 
cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell  
this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( "" speed "" 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth  
his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge  
instead , he adds to the phoniness  
theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation "" cider house rules , "" he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited "" sleepy hollow  "" 
undeserving of such talent , "" the astronaut's wife "" manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs

-1,"way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad  
one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance  
after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his "" target ""  
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate  
but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty  
here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory  
it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion  
unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that  
as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man  
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed  
but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit  
directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity  
unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it  
the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is  
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life  
even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc  i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously "" dramatic ""  
usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending  
nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential  
thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled "
-1,"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king  
unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore  
plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers  
critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "" evil "" characters  
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles  
the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about  
of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified  
and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? )  
am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? 
or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? 
well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin  
furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story  
in fact , the story is empty within itself  
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not  
wow  
how interesting  
the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie )  
whip out those thinking caps , kids ! 
hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity  
hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls  
what a crock ! 
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging  
in fact , it was one big bore  
i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin "

it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title  
opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son  
but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief  
from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery  
again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph  
we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l  jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity  
the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it  
morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention  
 "" the red violin "" could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony  
however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer  
here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact

king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings  
it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains  
ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen  
his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ? 
the addiction is that movie  
walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout  
the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island )  
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model  ) 
matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
no kidding  
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle  
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him  
no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon  
in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs  
wider ! ) 
toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out  
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was  
suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all  
the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea "

-1,"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered ? 
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me    
keep reading )  
also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was )  
this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it  
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them  
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos "

-1,"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality  
here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves  
swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless  
alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up  
what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter  
my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here )  
it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience  
maybe it will work for some people  
it didn't work for me  
billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania  
he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film  
the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall  
his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size  
subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago  
max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins  
sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved  
sam is broke  
max is dying

-1,"a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets  
the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities  
the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were  
on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast  
but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud  
i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade  
he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be  
but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch  
leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring  
the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems  
he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville  
once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her  
when verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they're bad poets  "" 
he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship  
verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud  
when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers  
it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce  
in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail  
while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19  
he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 "

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic "

-1,"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment  
with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance  
however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker  
this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center  
the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma  
they have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday  
now the three surviving girls must decide what to do  
it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up  
the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience  
to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth  
the girls' cover is surely blown    
not so fast  
thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance  
after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd  
does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? 
or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? 
jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add  
it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor  
it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot  
the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo "
-1,"there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical "" naked gun "" films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's committed himself to starring in since  
the wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable  
to be fair , "" wrongfully accused , "" the send-up in question and nielsen's third parody since the last "" gun , "" isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his "" dracula : dead and loving it "" or "" spy hard , "" which is a mighty good thing  
nielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon  
 "" wrongfully accused "" meshes together the premises of "" the fugitive "" and "" patriot games , "" casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock )  
she , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl )  
harrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u  s  marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones' already smirky oscar-winning role )  
there's also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u  n  secretary general , but like any of it matters  
 "" wrongfully accused "" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted "" lord of the violin "" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage  
nice touch  
most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener  
 ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and "" baywatch "" goofs  ) 
movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty  
when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la "" anaconda "" or baseball players disappear into a "" field of dreams "" -esque cornfield , there's really nothing to laugh at  
other moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at  
there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick "
-1,"the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective  
such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks  
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends  
examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house  
the killer wears one of those l  l  bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face  
i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days  
anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric  
it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come  
unfortunately , the film never takes off from there  
the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus  
like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac )  
i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill  
after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares  
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music  
i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days  
the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast  
the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew  
false scares should always be used in moderation "
-1,"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry

-1,"the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here  ' 
there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest  
it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves  
if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with  
alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral  
wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey  
pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills  
the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life  
the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio  
so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner  
adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive  
daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there  
during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel  
with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla  
during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t  s  
eliot ( corbin allred ) reader  
but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional  
when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly  
the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams "
-1,"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects  
set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon  
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells  
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes  
not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood  
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? 
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play  
this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale  
the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere  
in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box  
not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted  
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot  
not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame  
when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail  
with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion  
abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft  
appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched  
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration  
otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable  
ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings  
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful "

so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! 
what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson

-1,"i have a confession  
even though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i've never seen any of the original godzillas  
 ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u  s  godzilla released in 1998 ; it's the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu  ) 
so , part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise  
this was a long-awaited treat  
i was expecting a goofy good time , complete with bad dubbing , science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line  
the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring  
i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt  
you do get all of the "" so bad they're good "" traits so normally associated with the franchise  
but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot  
it's a deal i wasn't willing to accept  
hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura's script crams in way too many details , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them  
the maneuver is not only disconcerting , but gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel  
godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops  
was it a whim ?

-1,"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island  
however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder  
while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself  
conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation  
his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice  
the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst  
without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement  
on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism  
in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another  
the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel  
its absence in the film is unforgivable  
the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers  
alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with  
the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him  
jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible  
unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script  
the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach  
all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone  
this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions  
the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) "
-1,"in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather  
was it "" deep "" ? 
nope  
however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up  
it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was "" without the comic book uplift "" of the indiana jones and superman pictures  
which was true  
if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place  
if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn  
some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr  lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that "" this is batman as batman should be  "" ; 
mr  travers called it one of the ten best films of the year  
the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect  
there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton  
the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes  
the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman's body she gets pushed off a building  
i admire mr  burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess  
nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten  
hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast  
alas , these are only hints "
-1,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey  
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star  
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars  
that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way )  
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension  
i even liked the computer-generated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isn't too bad either  
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex )  
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven "
-1,"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way )  
the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely )  
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight  
i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" 
it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie  
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen  
kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more ""  
and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j  pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character ""    grammar 
be damned )  
 "" how did you know that ? "" 
the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along  
  
  
since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently  
he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects  
this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr  vehicles  
their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends ""

directed by kevin smith  
rated r  
jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior  
kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic  
but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission  
jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now  
they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood  
this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( "" what's the internet ? "" ) 
are talking trash about them  
what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ? 
on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ? 
-- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits  
of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film  
will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey  
the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past  
any appeal the movie has will come from the "" in "" jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is "" in "" to the point of absurdity  
there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness  
once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire  
countless "" hot "" movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer  
get it ? 
they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey ! 
a monkey ! 
as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat  
one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : "" the female clitoris ? "" 
kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film "
-1,"the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic  
finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  
combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs

in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? 
-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  
over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life  
he's screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter

a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them  
the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends  
one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up  
to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine  
jack is in even worse shape than harry  
he's dying of cancer with only a year to live  
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him  
instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes  
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before  
through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to  
it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about  
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario "

that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays  
 "" wild wild west "" is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault  
in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs  
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal  
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring  
will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character  
west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach

-1,"synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur  
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way  
comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television )  
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband )  
other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable  
stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do  
interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen  
after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears  
the narrator states that "" this is the story of daryl gleason "" and tells the audience that he is the stalker  
of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels  
if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked  
okay  so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required  
stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious  
the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together  
daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her  
ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate  
these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet  
for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked "
-1," "" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd  "" 
actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts  
it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash  
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king )  
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton )  
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche  
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did  
of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche  
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  
judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation "

-1,"synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall  
comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it  
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film )  
strike two came while the previews played  
did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? 
well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign )  
tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout  
about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery  
to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller  
wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title  
james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten  
brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company  
by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious  
apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city  
but , then again , what do i know about business ? 
i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch  
larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill  
this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it  
the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game  
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help  
some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film  
the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two "
-1,"arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year  
however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good  
donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth  
the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles  
although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on  
although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity  
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise  
most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie  
the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students  
there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly  
if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp  
but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how  
the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes  
with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not  
i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film  
however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' 
a lot , and mike giggling like a loony  
there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things  
the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all  
the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing  
also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation "

but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead  
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again  
she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line  
they sacked him after he got sick  
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation  
that actually is the whole storyline  
speed 2 could do without dialogues  
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound  
i don't really know why this is called an action movie

-1,"unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop  
there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain  
the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film  
bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia  
on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? )  
then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon )  
right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama  
but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point  
dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from  
the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death  
once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue  
whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably  
aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good  
baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop  
penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop  
what one tough cop lacks is originality  
this film offers nothing new  
nothing that you can't get from any cop film

-1,"when the mediums in question are video game and feature film , has there ever been a respective here-to-there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle-headed mediocrity ? 
 "" super mario bros  , "" "" street fighter "" and "" mortal kombat "" were silly stinkers all , and now the empty , execrable "" wing commander "" joins their lowly ranks  
enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci-fi , easily the worst of its kind , is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - that is to say , there's little fun to be had when you're not the one holding the joystick  
the movie , then , is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts , who created the original , groundbreaking pc incarnation of "" wing commander "" back in 1990  
how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head-scratcher  
 "" wing commander "" 's story , credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney , is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas  
it rips off the finest films of its genre , top gun and , in one scene , even those spiffy "" stereoscopic freeze "" gap commercials  
set in 2654 , "" wing commander "" stars freddie prinze jr  as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him  
along the way , he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior ( saffron burrows ) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted , comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his "" pilgrim "" heritage ( don't ask ) , and goes on a top-secret mission involving the "" jump coordinates "" ( what , no death star plans ? ) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi  
or something like that  
given the immensely confusing activity , it's hard to tell  
on the other hand , what's easy to see is that "" wing commander "" is a big old mess  
the lame dialogue strains , filled with such original lines as "" don't you die on me ! "" , 
 "" battle stations ! "" 
and repeated ( and frequently unanswered ) calls for a "" medic ! "" 
action sequences fizzle  
the character conflict garners unintentional giggles  
the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like , as they're kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes  
imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a ? 50s roger corman cheapie and you've got a good idea  
little but techno-babble happens for an hour , and then it's as if "" wing commander "" tries to do too much at once ; when it appears as though the movie's about to show signs of a pulse , it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before  
matthew lillard , featured prominently in said sequence , is cast as prinze's hotshot partner , and though the two are fine young actors - recently paired in the hit "" she's all that "" - they're fighting more than otherworldly evil here  
rumor has it that "" wing commander "" was slated as a later-in-the-year release , bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new "" star wars : episode i "" trailer "

paul verhoeven's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity  
it stank  
starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore  
it stinks  
nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here's a brief synopsis anyway  
some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy  
after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared  
this involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs' planet  
much carnage ensues  
the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call  
more carnage ensues  
after being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a "" brain bug "" which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans ( look , i didn't write this , ok ? )  
yet more carnage ensues  
get the picture ? 
interspersed throughout all this are brief "" ads "" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven's robocop  
there are many problems with starship troopers  
the plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly  
harris ( star of tv's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a "" brain bug "" later on  
in addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210  
the characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it's ok because she got to sleep with rico  
i had hoped that verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him "
-1,"isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than "" it sucks "" ? 
one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie  
i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although "" boring , "" "" stupid "" and "" absurd "" doesn't amount to much of a review  
a shame  
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate  
but c'est la vie  
here goes nothing  
i'll keep it short  
i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee  
the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie  
hill's and mgm's actions were prudent  
when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command  
the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony  
one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means  
this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it  
another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups  
evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger  
how ? 
why ? 
the movie never bothers to explain  
soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli  
to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why  
i just remember that i didn't care "
-1,"you'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games  
it hasn't worked so far  
 "" street fighter ? "" 
 "" super mario brothers ? "" 
 "" wing commander ? "" 
 "" mortal kombat ? "" 
not a watchable film in the bunch  
still i held out some hope for "" tomb raider  "" 
after all , the game's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept  
however , despite the potential of the project , "" tomb raider "" proves to be yet another bomb  
the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies  
there's a once-ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world  
of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world  
our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up  
she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead  
of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway  
in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences  
however , the action in "" tomb raider "" shows little style or originality  
there's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin' , but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct-to-cable flick  
the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer , "" the mummy returns , "" was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large-scale  
since winning her academy award for "" girl , interrupted , "" jolie hasn't taken any projects that would display her acting talents  
 "" tomb raider "" seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts ; so much attention is drawn to them that it's a shame there's no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra  
while we don't see much of her acting ability ( with the exception of a wonderful upper-crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie's less savory side  
considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her ) seems a poor choice "
-1,"as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients  
he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony  
and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer  
in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal  
his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino )  
he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division  
lomax is soon given the case of his life  
he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide  
the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell  
he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron )  
but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story  
it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed  
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm  
quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago  
freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed  
the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts  
the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer  
the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax  
unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere  
granted , the film is very handsome-looking "
-1,
-1,"when i originally saw the trailer for "" analyze this "" a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame  
and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad  
but then when "" analyze this "" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened  
it got great reviews  
critics were proclaiming it "" hilarious "" and a "" dead-on parody of mob movies ""  
well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater  
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? 
well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for  
 "" analyze this "" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted  
don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here  
i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material  
he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama  
if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the "" naked gun "" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful  
as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others  
this doesn't work  
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him  
and the movie is badly paced , too  
it never takes off  
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum  
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script  
it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere "
-1,"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch  
based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover  
however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion  
of course , the ads make it seem like so much more  
quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like  
sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? 
after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not  
the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough  
the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half  
and with it comes every single clich ?  
it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen  
the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden  
claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience  
the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching  
unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time  
with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset  
despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset  
information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable  
the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't  
basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two )  
the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them "
-1,"dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it  
although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one "" dead bore  "" 
in the film , johnson plays    
you guessed it    
a cop  
the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on "" miami vice  "" 
a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life  
beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children

-1,"at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong  
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts  
that's "" dirty work "" in a nutshell  
a very different kind of movie  
this is not a movie that i can easily review  
the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters  
  
  and 
tells me this movie is terrible  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
it's a one note concept  
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in "" happy gilmore "" and "" veronica's closet "" seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend's grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house  
first the critic in me  
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way  
here's the catch  
none of the characters are sympathetic  
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want  
the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people "
-1," "" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? "" 
that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie  
let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie  
so bad , it's almost good  
almost , but not quite  
the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth  
it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies  
the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody  
that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986  
he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies  
a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs  
it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs  
the acting is bad with a capital b  the story is worse  
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie  
the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow  
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it  
actually , it was the high point of the movie for me  
of course , that isn't really saying much  
the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion  
which gives it a leg up on some other horror films "
-1,"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner  
his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  
hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts  
whichever one you like , dear , he says  
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries  
i liked that scene for two reasons  
first , the cakes looked really cool  
second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  
it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely )  
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  
i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy  
case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  
however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  
 ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense  ) 
it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished "

if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live  
and this includes keanu reeves  
what do i hate about seagal ? 
i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint )  
i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold's hairpiece in "" boogie nights  "" 
i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights  
i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain  
i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place )  
and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him )  
sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago )  
but the guy makes worse films than reagan did  
so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ? 
well    something 
about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight  
i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! )  
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off  
i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ? 
so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy  
and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film  
but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) "
-1,"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels  
first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  
but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  
no no    
just kidding  
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games  
the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants )  
the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  
unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game  
i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve  
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  
and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office  
mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  
shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid  
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now "

elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth  
tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth  
also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother  
while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one  
the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all  
only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters  
and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not  
the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements  
mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame  
the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good  
she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist  
robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money  
elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i  e  
flipper , 1996 )  
his role is also vastly underwritten

sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? 
then there's "" caligula  "" 
this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc  this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time  
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining  
after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  
no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes )  
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time  
 "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or 
so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  
the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place )  
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die    so he kills him and ascends to the throne  
then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off  
the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity "
-1,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career "

-1,"mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla  
his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have  
joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars  
during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , "" wow  
that's some ape  "" 
joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla  
he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people  
he picks things up and stares at them pensively  
he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness  
joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes  
as a character , he doesn't quite register  
and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come  
the words "" family entertainment "" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart  
the picture is a remake of the 1949 film  
it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters  
the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas  
as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife  
specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood  
soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother  
so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers "
-1," "" from the director of "" the nightmare before christmas "" it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million  
to each it's own however , since "" monkey bone "" is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made  
a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects  
stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena "" monkey bone "" a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder  
when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you'll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i'm guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life  
people are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them  
when stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can't stand ) he tries to keep him under control  
making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life  
when monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body  
now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares    or 
something like that  
rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) "" monkey bone "" had potential in the script and even the story  
what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development  
for instance we really don't get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? 
kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her  
the cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body  
bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast  
dave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as "" will & grace's "" megan mullally who can be funny  
the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust "
-1,"it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters  
this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd    "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations  
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla

-1,"tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies  
and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes  
i didn't expect much from this latest "" interpretation "" of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes  
i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those "" damn dirty apes , "" in one of his best roles of his career ? 
sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off  
this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x  marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u  s  air force pilot  
leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered "" smart "" chimps into the storms to collect data  
leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle  
leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter )  
the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship  
along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! 
in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene  
while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the "" surprise "" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple  
wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences  
this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film  
the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human  
even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey  
but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton  
even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film "
-1,"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it  
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence  
i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it  
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began  
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film  
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous  
it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex  
it's a suspense film with no suspense  
it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden  
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself  
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally  
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends  
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject  
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes )  
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people  
so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it  
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense

-1,"plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who's planning a bank heist  
mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy's jazz club  
they're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption  
meanwhile wendy's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues 
the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work  
unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the "" what the hell where they thinking "" category that takes up 98% of the rest  
but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller  
leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on  
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut  
the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two  
which is unfortunately , the other main story isn't any great shakes either  
the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled  
at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn't improve on repeated viewing  
there is no doubt that this film's achilles heel is its script  
as for the rest of the cast , it's a mixed bag  
john flaus , one of australia's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder  
although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off  
dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn't given a whole lot to do  
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes  
i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element  
cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo "

-1,"some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it  
thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story  
it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) 
when rubin was only ten  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison  
to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives  
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education  
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin's autobiography  
immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra "" sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us  "" 
hmmm  
after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  
of course , we're already told that he's innocent  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version  
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it "
-1,"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon  
as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque  
the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style "" chance brushstrokes  "" 
starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  
the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections  
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man  
daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer  
when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex  
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed  
he thinks that francis's paintings have "" no bloody use , "" and the movie presents no counterargument  
writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma  
we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's "" amorality and innocence  "" 
francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often  
 "" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , "" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match  
as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood  
francis appears to be in complete ecstasy  
another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities  
as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience

-1,"in our time  
in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man'  
and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic  
in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away  
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry  
the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese  
the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered  
the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers  
it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death  
escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate  
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty  
the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy   
there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production  
and there are more problems besides its title  
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece  
we call it 'modernization'  
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights  
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing  
kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature "

it seems that a woman has also been kidnapped--she is the sister of one of them ( e  t  's

they even cut off walken's finger to show they mean business , because they are desperate to save the woman's life  
suicide kings is a terrible film  
walken aside , there isn't a single appealing cast member  
o'fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance  
in an amusingly unironic scene , walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a tee--it's as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director  
the plot is another issue entirely  
o'fallon is someone whom i'm betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times , for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return ( do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster , which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary's character , or the numerous anecdotal sequences ? ) , but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess , filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses

-1,"the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes  
alas , it refers to our heroes ! 
as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further  
after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one  
but the human race doesn't have much to worry about  
after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus  
she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus )  
they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters  
lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board  
the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship  
soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened  
finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! 
it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! 
virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation  
when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene  
it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising  
i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative  
virus takes itself seriously  
and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming  
but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out  
okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity  
they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that )  
on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people "

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup  
any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half  
the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill  
nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide  
nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills  
of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch  
learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him  
this is a promising premise , and mr  taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character  
this is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux  
however , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable  
unfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits  
far from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond  
mr  taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as "" you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? ' 
- see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions  "" ) 
the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes  
this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes  
the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability "
-1,"to sum the entire film "" 54 "" up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead  
 "" 54 "" , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public  
a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco  
the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio "" 54 ""  
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach  
he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co-owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive  
he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender  
  
  
you expected more , didn't you  
there isn't  
the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax ( isn't that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud  
the glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it's glamour  
for much of its target audience , college age to early thirties , it attempts to show celebrities mixing with "" normal people  "" 
this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote  
you can be sure that half of the audience hasn't heard of them , another quarter only know their names , and the other quarter knew they were there already  
the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell  
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive  
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued , almost nostalgic performance , when needed  
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on "" coffee talk "" sans dress and wig "
-1," "" desperate measures "" is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic  
it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "" before and after "" than "" reversal of fortune  "" 
the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing  
too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use  
san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission  
even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society  
connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital  
when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy  
one misstep "" desperate measures "" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness  
what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow  
take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital  
the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? 
he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight  
connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son  
whatever  
to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems  
first and foremost is how cheaply "" desperate measures "" trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour  
once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills  
there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away  
also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; "" desperate measures "" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this  
there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department "

dances with wolves was golden and brown-it looked like an eggo commercial

-1,"for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers  
apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it  
in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid  
madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp  
she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover  
already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men  
what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well  
madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition  
 ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy  
this movie leave no scummy stone unturned  ) 
anyway  willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality  
how do we know this ? 
because his character is set up with the token wife and kids  
how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? 
and get kicked out of the house ? 
and get welcomed back anyway ? 
don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up  
dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie  
most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs  
don't ask  
another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull  
what's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes  
the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes "
-1,"in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america  
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question  
instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind  
 "" in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "" 
he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked  
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws  
perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage  
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy  
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however  
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her  
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding  
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner )  
through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage  
and he has to ask to borrow clothing  
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down  
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes  
greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to  
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law  
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship  
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films  
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived "
-1,"what a contrast ! 
in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly  
i'm not sure you could get two more different movies  
while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it  
this is one interesting movie  
it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty  
there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men  
hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him  
his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? 
and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? 
 "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen  
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? 
this is not a movie for answers  
donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions  
that's what makes this movie stay on your mind  
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time  
even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do  
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly  
i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this  
eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable  
i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him

i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend

-1,"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller  
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may  
both those films were tense exercises in chills  
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer  
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively  
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed  
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot  
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay  
the thrills all came from the plot  
ronin is like a film made by another man  
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it  
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j  d  zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure  
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai  
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west  
if you miss the opening , do not worry  
this film will explain again what a ronin is

he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer "

of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title   )

but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )

-1,"`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor  
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter  
i chuckled incessantly , all the way home  
let me share  
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college )  
luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report  
despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization  
soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account  
yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? 
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable  
the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense  
unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting  
it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars     
but not the script  
`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  
first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm  
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar

-1,"the crown jewel of 1970's irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship  
the story begins on the u  s  s  
poseidon's big new year's cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive  
let's see , there's the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to "" pray to that part of god within yourself  "" 
there's the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her  
there's the hippie singer ( "" there's got to be a morning after    "" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed  
and to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall  
we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship  
everyone's in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down  
the second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship  
in this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom  
or is the bottom the top ? 
either way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees  
thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc  while the ship slowly fills with water behind them

 ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip  
for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup  
this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective  ) 
snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater  
snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ?

the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer  
if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate  
the trailer is a work of sheer genius  
it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot  
the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross  
 ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) 
but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie  
the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match  
unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot  
the trailer gives away much , too much of the story  
the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy  
the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is  
without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level "

i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last  
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose  
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out  
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag  
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s  thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  
operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr  
gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers  
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  
dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax  
and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead  
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view  
thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document "
-1,"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money  
wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies  
will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses  
he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing  
west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr  loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache  ) 
before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives  
there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough  
there's also a pleasant soundtrack  
buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes  
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see  
apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works  
firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money  
one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise  
both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end  
not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy  
therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious  
the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing  
she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith  
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character "

normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be  
but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg  
i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all  
maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny  
in mine , it's not  
or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking  
because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one  
at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing  
brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it  
wrong mel ! 
i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere  
this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad  
he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out  
but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them  
the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr  
 ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name  ) 
lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave  
hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass

in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good  
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful  
one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery  
as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers  
unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy  
to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture  
firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot  
the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively  
we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people  
during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive  
flash-forward a year  
now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn )  
but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual  
a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom  
led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border  
along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) "
-1,"according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time  
take for example "" casablanca  "" 
great film , even today  
it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  
but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film  "" 
but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated  
thus , the curse of the "" event film  "" 
 "" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation )  
but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well , this kid is the "" event film "" in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama  
one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 
now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls  
and "" independence day "" has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars "
-1,"in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism  
which wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies  
in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany  
of course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons  
for them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era  
which , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience  
one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn  
salon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2  
in 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats  
none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged  
the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise  
screenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names  
schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top  
kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer  
caught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel  
there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe  
when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged  
she informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg  
those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation  
but , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty "
-1,"movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past

the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon , arizona  
community college science profs ira kane ( david duchovny ) and harry block ( orlando jones ) take some samples from the meteor and discover that one-celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly , doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth  
just about the time i was wondering , "" hey , doesn't the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies , "" the government came in and took over the whole area  
the leader of the pack , gen  woodman ( ted levine ) , turns out to be an old nemesis of ira's , and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research  
meanwhile , the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people  
by this time , ira and harry have gained a friend in dr  allison reed ( julianne moore ) of the center for disease control  
a country club poolboy , wayne green ( seann william scott ) , has also attached himself to the merry band  
but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time ? 
director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984's "" ghostbusters , "" but "" evolution "" falls miserably short  
one reason is readily apparent  
 "" ghostbusters "" had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but "" evolution "" has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else's hands  
for good measure , "" ghostbusters "" had the comic talents of rick moranis ; "" evolution "" offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in "" american pie "" and "" road trip "" than he is here  
scott has one amusing scene where he sings "" you are so beautiful to me "" to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap  
other than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him

even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all

-1,"i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question  
let's say you've just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious  
your friends have left to go get help , and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up  
a tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on  
he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck  
do you : 
a ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , 
b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? 
if you answered "" a "" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" and will likely hate this movie  
however , if you answered "" b "" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! 
 "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" is being called a sequel , but it's really more of a remake of the original  
there's a few changes here and there , but it's essentially the same ( even the infamous "" meathook "" scene has been re-created  ) 
the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere  
needless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family  
much carnage ensues  
to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly  
in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere  
it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel  
no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel  
the dialogue is even more atrocious  
zellwegger , who is kidnapped by "" the family "" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people  
when you're surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window  
speaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window  
apparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window "
-1," "" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club  "" 
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning  
director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge  
with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out  
this just goes to show that hype kills  
it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception  
the story goes like this  
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter )  
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended  
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain  
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse  
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt )  
the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight  
how do they come up with this stuff ? 
anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed  
out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message  
fincher shows us that society is like robots  
we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out  
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others  
call me crazy , but this is common knowledge  
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably "

even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i

everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand  
in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway

now before you go assuming i'm some sort of high brow snob , who can't appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor  
i thought there's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998  
low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component  
i wanted to like the waterboy , i really did  
i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie  
actually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that  
not a great record for a 90-minute film  
the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies  
those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material  
nothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film  
it's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny  
i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents  
if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live  
most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry  
sandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team  
the team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field  
you can figure out the rest from here  
sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star  
as i said , the film had a great deal of potential "

i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr  cameron's early works  
in fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future  
no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him  
in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget  
the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter's twisted remake of "" the thing  "" 
 "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water  
they get on  
they break up into pairs and investigate  
and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha )  
not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters  
of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper  
and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn  
i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed  
like anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo 'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance )  
or peter o'toole in "" caligula  "" 
great actor , horrific performance  
it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film  
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects  "
-1,"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 
regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words  
you have to see it and experience it for yourself  
here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so  
yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  
in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  
don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off  
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme  
it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark  
as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  
now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess  
i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off  
for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing  
i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap )  
i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film  
ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem  
rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film  
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 
in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  
in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  
but what a strange mess it is "

-1,"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy  
there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group  
this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core  
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998  
i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch  
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story  
what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it  
using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once  
that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex  
both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?  
the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat  
the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound  
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on )  
the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs  
kevin bacon ) is familiar with "
-1,"in the james bond film "" diamonds are forever , "" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads  
bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match  
well , collars and cuffs don't match in "" the real blonde  "" 
what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen  
the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin  
it plays like an "" ally mcbeal "" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary "" fantasy "" sequences  
writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea  
it isn't  
the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary  
matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent  
he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas  
 "" that's not really acting "" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex  
but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video  
but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after "" showgirls "" )  
this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes  
dicillo has referred to "" the real blonde "" as "" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff    "" 
the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting  
catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant "" living in oblivion "" ) , is at her most annoying in "" the real blonde "
-1,"chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying  
i think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in "" the fifth element "" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle "" money talks "" just doesn't do him service  
tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie  
in fact , if you see "" money talks , "" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of "" toy story "" 's writers penned the sloppy script  
tucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen )  
after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael )  
but villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo  
the local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture  
he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview  
this means james must present his new "" friend "" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino )  
and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james  
 "" this ain't no buddy movie , "" claim the print ads  
yeah , right  
actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears "" money talks "" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker  
this is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role  
but you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing "" money talks "" has going for it  
and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make  
it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with "" money talks  "" 
the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when "" nothing to lose "" employed it last month  
everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers "

-1,"synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system  
the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris  
comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h  robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film  
both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality )  
interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively  
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction  
it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality  
unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie  
virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins )  
the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses  
many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly  
the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles  
jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character  
carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise  
meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either  
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background  
in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch  
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt  
this turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either "
-1,"it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy  
and no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office  
really , i don't  
not at all  
the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it  
the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? 
in the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore  
she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott  
he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him  
after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh )  
kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck )  
to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits  
supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing  
their purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone  
to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting  
rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them  
this is the love letter's damning error  
capshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional  
because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere  
even worse -- it's a bore  
i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist "

 "" the sculptress "" is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended  
from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format  
that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( "" the lawnmower man "" ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills  
when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced "" hamlet "" soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women  
fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! )  
 "" do you have a castle ? "" 
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop  
 "" jah  
with ze many turrets "" is dobie's perplexing reply  
the real "" star "" of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title  
sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a "" genius "" frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau  
that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and "" rosemary's baby "" -inspired imagery )  
bauchau's character criticizes sarah's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she's possessed    
by an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner  
whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there  
on the other side of the wall , dobie's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like "" actor delivers a stunning macbeth , "" actor courted by hollywood studio , "" "" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , "" and "" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal  "" 
the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed "
-1,"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning  
based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros  a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west  
but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again  
and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects  
i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? 
the answer is just about everything  
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate  
there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression  
but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it  
at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting  
will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series  
my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved  
smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him  
he's too much of a joker  
i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible  
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office  
the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists  
the trail leads to the diabolical dr  arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent  
loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns "

you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that  
when did banality and pandering become okay ? 
just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ? 
charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages  
charlie's angels is dumb  
just plain dumb  
as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie  
they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion  
and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party  
the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company  
of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe  
the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair  
the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp  
the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother  
charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight  
nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions  
it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one  
diaz is a knucklehead  
barrymore is the "" dangerous one , "" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role

-1,"phew , what a mess ! 
for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on  
she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him  
is one of jerry's conjectures correct ? 
 * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? 
is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? 
is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? 
no , no , and no  
as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background  
 ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms  roberts herself  ) 
the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip  
mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating  
 ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? ) 
even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair  
there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container  
 ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge  ) 
other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion  
 ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw  ) 
let's see , other pleasures include    
a brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall  
oh , pretty woman ! 
getting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story  
the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable  
more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts "

the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere  
the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time  
a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found  
although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends  
one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated  
whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases  
or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family  
another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death  
he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well  
boyd is the ? doer' of the group

i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film  
despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie  
sadly , though , my fears were realized  
it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes  
the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion  
she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have  
the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab  
this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it  
in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use  
no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me  
quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed  
the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging  
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend  
these early scenes were interesting  
we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before  
the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model  
>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end  
it all seemed so excessive "

-1," "" the 44 caliber killer has struck again  "" 
starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth  
rated r  
summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities  
lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg  
but here , he gets himself into a bind  
his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work  
the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city  
it was the hottest summer on record  
to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population  
so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city  
the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters  
we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings  
vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her  
ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more "" eccentric , "" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend  
tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again  
a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects  
at the top of the list is ritchie  
vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend  
as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded "" so what ? "" 
question springs to mind "
-1,"there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year  
in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600  
this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys  
here's what happens this time  
it's night at the white house  
a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt  
the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in  
how do we know he's a hotshot ? 
we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene  
it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street  
snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all  
in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all  
alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison    
a very dangerous liaison  
well , not really , i just wanted to say that  
almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos  
snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son  
snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information  
for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting "
-1,"at the end of an action scene in "" lara croft : tomb raider , "" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior  
with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says "" oh , my car keys ! "" 
i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile  
based on an incredibly popular video game , "" lara croft : tomb raider "" is a lousy movie  
the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc  etc  , the end  
basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits  
close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms  
running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage "" baywatch "" fashion  
there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them  
but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly  
the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy  
for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la "" austin powers  "" 
now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? 
of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? 
 "" tomb raider "" sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts )  
it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies  
throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons  
intended to be a rousing "" indiana jones "" style adventure , "" tomb raider "" lacks any sense of tension  
the low point comes when lara is "" threatened "" by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi  
easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun  
if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors "
-1,"if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for "" wild wild west , "" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae  
these treats are great relief from the summer heat  
in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment  
i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat  
this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat  
in this film , they are no where to be found  
what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula  
two men are asked to stop this threat  
one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents  
among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest  
the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating  
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act  
for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with  
 "" now touch my breast , "" west says  
gordon does so and then softly coos his approval  
i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness  
the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter  
i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith  
could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ? 
it was as if the director was yelling "" will smith , do your own thing  "

-1,"one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre  
suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in  
when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? 
i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place  
to be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it  
right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with  
eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment  
meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime  
when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude  
gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with  
the previous incarnation of "" gloria "" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars  
there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch  
i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again  
these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers  
throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , "" who really cares ? "" 
as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all  
in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better  
although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored  
jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag  
all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help  
sony , the studio that released "" gloria , "" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them  
they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved "
-1,"an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer  
you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence  
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys  
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves  
all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office  
the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking  
the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' 
the writing behind this project is embarrassing  
for your amusement , i will explain the plot  
dr  kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr  heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on  
as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences  
when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler  
kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team  
there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! 
 ( a far superior film in any league )  
you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene  
sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics  
question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? 
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers  
it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula  
i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors "
-1,"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981  
monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party  
everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things  
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all  
this disappointed me greatly  
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion  
lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd  
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin  
she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent  
there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie  
when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party  
at the bar , he runs into two more girls  
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names  
ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance  
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad "
-1,"robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein  
mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit  
unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world  
it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce  
the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves  
this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie  
mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on  
the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice  
cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard  
he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis  
he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham ""  
a good adventure plot that is sadly unused  
elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating  
neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable  
perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone  
this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre  
much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre  
chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever  
scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting  
perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive "
-1,
-1,"well , here's a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release  
after just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? 
it is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was  
at least some smut would have livened things up a bit  
 "" porky's , "" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid  
women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet )  
their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's  
after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building  
for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's  
 "" porky's , "" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level  
as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough  
as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat  
as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave  
and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore  
one of the most offensive things about , "" porky's , "" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers  
the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool  
that sure is revealing information  
the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark  
the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people  
for example , the two gym teachers , mrs  balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of "
-1,"jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons , an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities  
chan plays separated-at-births boomer and john ma , whose drastically different paths    
aw , forget the plot description , it's not even worth the space  
but let's face it  
no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway  
the scenes where nothing happens in chan's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together  
in the case of twin dragons , however , the tiresome plot-driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout ( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema ) , "" get to the good part already ! "" 
most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other's existence from their own acquaintances  
why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained , but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot  
the twins' love interests , demure club-singer barbara ( chan-film regular maggie cheung ) and lusty bride-hopeful tammy ( nina li chi ) , get disoriented in all the brouhaha , yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with  
the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot ( in several shots , in fact , even the make-up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which  )  
even chan's so-corny-it's-funny humor is off-kilter in this outing  
some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they're annoying  
a case in point : whenever anyone sees the brothers together , they fall to the ground in a dead faint  
are we laughing yet ? 
as usual , the final showdown is the film's jewel , a tour de force display of chan' s agility and grace  
never mind that it's not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash-testing facility  
it's all good fun , but too little too late  
perhaps chan's next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies "
-1,"the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film  
it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction  
that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller  
the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense  
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u  s  army's criminal investigation division  
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation  
complicating the case is the fact that capt  campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee  
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in  
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid  
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems  
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze  
director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw  
it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them  
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans  
west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter  
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits  
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell "
-1,"i am a steven seagal fan  
i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things  
any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on  
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine  
not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull  
in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest  
he's also put on quite a lot of weight  
small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? 
 ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later )  
as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past  
while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole  
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing  
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons  
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en )  
it's the other changes that disappoint  
for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour  "" 
wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest  
as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching  
a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble  
he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies  
again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual "
-1,"retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson 
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted ""  
and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead  
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them  
two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure  
and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction  
the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts  
for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth  
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george )  
that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? 
and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ? 
anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches  
fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction  
the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable  
not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious "" lets explain the plot "" type approach  
mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch  
and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses  
christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care  
in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond  
as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here  
he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of  
and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film  
long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing "
-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show "
-1,"janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker  
this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs  
it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too  
garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o  sanders ) running for reelection  
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular  
so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit  
she soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this  
the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on  
then comes what roger ebert calls the "" meet cute  "" 
it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way  
in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side  
no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage  
also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight  
that's how it works in movies like these  
i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits  
i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet  
garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss  
milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together  
rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara "
-1,">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong  
at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world  
courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school  
everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity  
courtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group  
it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz  
just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else  
and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie  
and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth  
this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school  
>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing  
not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast  
judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has  
also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers  
on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996's scream  
mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film  
she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her  
faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles  
when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles  
gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker "
-1,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
it's confounding  
i can't believe a film can be this bad  
and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself  
while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  
on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted )  
but the film fails fundamentally in execution "
-1,
-1,"let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series  
it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof  
an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title  
a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse  
the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore's 007  
there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency  
it's as much of a mess as it sounds  
bond is "" helped "" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn't possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo  
during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever  
maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie  
scaramanga's lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures  
worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie  
there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour )  
the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the "" action "" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j  w  
pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die "" fame "" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window  
he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie  
even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print  
on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga's "" funhouse ""  
the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior "" the spy who loved me "" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive "

-1,"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england  
the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects  
more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character  
even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive  
although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive  
the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure  
if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980  
and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing  
well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film  
but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary  
with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens  
you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint  
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen  
but john , it just wasn't scary  
i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me  
actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films  
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me  
it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material  
call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it  
i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up "
-1,"so much for sweet returns  
after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's "" scream , "" and followed by "" scream 2 , "" "" urban legend , "" and the original , "" i know what you did last summer , "" a film like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" was bound to be made sooner or late  
it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits  
it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean  
since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together  
when julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr  , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up  
when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them  
of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all  
it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" is made  
i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to "" ikwydls , "" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a "" friday the 13th "" movie  
while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , "" i still know    "" 
has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested  
also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on  
while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died  
they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman  
another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy )  
since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water "
-1,"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life  
i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves  
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  
a little imagination goes a long way  
in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him  
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions  
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned  
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  
what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional  
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help  
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills  
part of this is a result of the film's slow pace  
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill  
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time "

-1,"before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder  
as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing  
the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment  
the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair  
if i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen  
less wrinkles  
anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife  
mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses  
unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast  
in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w  ) 
the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts  
not too good for a 'thriller  ' 
also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par  
paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie  
mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent  
which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does  
however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside  
also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective  
again , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet  
the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc "
-1,"a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama  
it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past  
the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell )  
her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst  
her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin  
he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city  
out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr  apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about  
the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws  
chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs  kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk  
the stern mr  kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses  
to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator  
the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality  
it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten  
the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters  
the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted  
the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith  
topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense "

sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out  
the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff  
hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in  
clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time  
and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it  
one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it  
nothing could be further from the truth  
i went into the theater expecting to love the movie  
the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters  
almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way  
when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement  
so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter  
i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway  
what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever

where to begin in criticizing this movie ? 
the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever  
there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence  
zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero  
so why does this movie get one star out of me ?

jalla ! jalla ! 
is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen  
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love  
the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park  roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background  
they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs  
roro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem  
roro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems  
it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny )

their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty , and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make-up and powder their cheeks  
under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public  
in writer and director darren stein's jawbreaker , it isn't as funny as it sounds  
in fact , it isn't funny at all  
stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm  
his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don't have time to add any emotion  
and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains  
the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 , liz , who is referred to as "" the princess di of reagan high , "" be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong  
the princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie  
granted , bad taste can sometimes be funny , but the mere presence of bad taste doesn't guarantee it  
liz's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth , tape her mouth shut , and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car  
when they open the trunk later , liz is dead

close-up thrill-shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear , which is a pretty good sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned

the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions  
it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  
in america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year

the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation

if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" may be just the film for you  
others will likely be less charitable  
while "" the odd couple ii "" is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt  
simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri  
the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years  
the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport  
they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of "" wacky "" adventures on the road  
jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob  
while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : "" grumpy old men , "" "" grumpier old men "" and "" out to sea  "" 
still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch  
matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons  
lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of "" phnah ! 
phnah ! "" 
despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together  
unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom  
one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club

-1,"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress  
that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot  
such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment  
one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent  
the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist  
you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less  
those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house  
others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness  
lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti )  
dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long )  
sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma  
indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming  
that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows  
big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs  
doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman  
unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters  
suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other  
of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny  
and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry  
unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) "
-1,"can you say "" dated "" ? 
you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release  
 "" mystery science theater 3000 "" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the "" good "" ones too  
rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success  
it all seems so harmless in the beginning  
mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed  
 ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration  ) 
their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming  
all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out  
when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen  
it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it  
and everyone's helping with the pregnancy  
the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66  6 
years  
meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight  
before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries  
that's when you know your health's failing  
the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma  
by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way  
rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie  
i guess someone put a spell on this movie "
-1,"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year  
earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs  
and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies  
starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend  
besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience  
at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber  
after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb  
with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making  
a timeless epic it is not  
besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands  
on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery  
there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne )  
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective  
jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard  
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast  
jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost  
quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble  
the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions  
faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience'  
all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful "
-1,"writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s  
yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8  5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 )  
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing  
and guess what ? 
he succeeds once again ! 
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems  
it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients  
critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
it is a drama  
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not  
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there  
now on to my review  
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was    he 
missed ! 
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible  
it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep  
i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks  
first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin  
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit

-1,"post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy's own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate  
 ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer's friend jennifer aniston  ) 
if only kevin smith could write them all    
schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) 's book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her  
they are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha's fidelity  
he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to "" test her ""  
the trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her  
to stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend  
hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast  
so hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex    
the script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a "" sensitive man "" , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble  
as for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things  
she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo  
there are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool  
i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks "" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? "" 
over and over until he's booted off stage  
there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page "
-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note

cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit

the director is paul verhoven  
that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre  
the problem is to keep us there  
i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time  
working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility  
the first two faces are completed  
now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human  
caine volunteers for this risky experiment  
but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong  
while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower  
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania  
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine  
soon every sense of decency is forgotten  
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody  
though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely

-1,"a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel  
well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller  
anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man  
the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it  
no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable  
the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist  
the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's )  
to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks  
some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less  
none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control  
this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable  
all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects  
the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves  
it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish  
also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? 
if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? 
regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it  
as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about  
the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles  
having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe  
watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely  
the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening "

not that there's anything wrong with scatology  
i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was  
it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable

adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing

frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you  
he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does  
frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground  
it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth  
nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth  
like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one  
after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences "

reviewed by dennis schwartz 
it's a love it or hate it film  
i simply hated it  
on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner  
it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed  
a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films  
it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other  
the plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist  
they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town  
they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops , they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage  
in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk , and burn down the store  
stopping off in a flop-house motel , richie rapes and slaughters the hostage  
these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that's possible  
on the tv news , it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers  
the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech ) , who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take  
with road blocks and car searches at the border , the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed  
there is the father , jacob fuller ( keitel ) , who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year-old , innocent daughter , kate ( lewis ) ; and , her shy brother scott ( liu )  
it's not explained how he happens to be chinese  
the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister  
the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title  
here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout "
-1,"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work  
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
with teaching mrs  tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope  
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  
and what a shame that is  
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
teaching mrs  tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren  
mrs  tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils  
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink "
-1,"jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today  
from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances  
on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong  
and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality  
hush is one such example  
lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium  
the film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama  
we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love  
jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange )  
the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs  
soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm )  
once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives  
as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war  
hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending )  
this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks  
frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire )  
meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object  
as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn  
here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle  
of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation "
-1," "" varsity blues "" is the best film of 1999 thus far  
unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999  
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999  
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game  "" 
by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? 
will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? 
will the team win the climactic game ? 
do cats bathe themselves regularly ? 
the so-called "" hero "" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town  
at least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming  
heck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before  
when the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter )  
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the "" bad guy "" )  
worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game  
the plotting of "" varsity blues "" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book  
admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained  
throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's "" all the right moves  "" 
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's "" dawson's creek "" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities  
while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and "" by-the-numbers "" screenplay by w  peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in "" all the right moves  "" 
the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama  
the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence  
smart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions  
it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts "
-1," "" something is fishy in the state of universal  "" 
about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies  
we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on  
to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim  
most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane  
 ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget  ) 
now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter  
 ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea  ) 
the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script  
the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through  
in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now  
the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet  
the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy  
somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis  
enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back  
we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola  
the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland  
played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing  
his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny  
the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner "
-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant "
-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros  made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere  
this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture  
and with good reason  
this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit  
remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin  
 ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes  ) 
uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage  
unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship  
at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr  fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days  
the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot  
when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs  peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent  
if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt  
the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption  
 ( they also sip a lot of tea  ) 
overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds "

director and writer : darren stein 
cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m  ali  
review by : geoff berkshire 
jawbreaker is the very definition of a "" rip-off  "" 
this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s  
along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own  
the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise  
liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind  
liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning  
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her  
they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body )  
courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her  
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to  
in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students  
up until about this point the film is effective enough  
however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull  
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch  
courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second  
meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot  
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ )  
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid "

really , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it

this is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen

if they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx

it was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was  
it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies  
one evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here  ) 
of course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution  
she gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ?

if it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) 
to fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d )  
the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much  
you see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent

 ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st  bernard for eve to care for  ) 
the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker  
there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life

a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i , however , would rather cut to the chase  
54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business  
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s  
i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes  
54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining  
it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses  
it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) "

turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger "

-1,"these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes  
but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers  
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south  
the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place  
one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade  
in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987  
seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america  
this time , however , third time wasn't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure  
eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback  
eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop  
the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley's boss  
determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart )  
when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles  
there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring  
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different  
in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn't work  
screenwriter steven e  de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys  
since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile  
unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children "

like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload  
de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic  
in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast  
only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material  
the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller  
ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene  
heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder  
 ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise  
only the latter is achieved  ) 
cage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money  
the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held  
with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn't know when to shut up  
spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , "" i was made for the sewer , baby ! "" 
actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole  
sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight  
but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess  
the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers  
the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not  
although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie  
the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden "

or "" mommy fearest  "" 
or "" the hand that robs the cradle  "" 
call it whatever you want , but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure  
chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given "" hush "" a send-off that's downright infuriating  
it's too bad that "" hush "" is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at  
paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan  
jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be  
but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much  
martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she's concerned  
if there's one reason to catch "" hush , "" it's lange  
she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field  
when she delves into martha's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch  
veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother  
the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow  
but can you really blame them ? 
the character relationships in "" hush "" hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity  
idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( "" why did you yell ? "" 
helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made  
you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? 
does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? 
if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , "" hush "" would be a really short movie  
and then there's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses  
after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself "

i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film  
there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative  
if there was a point to the film , i missed it  
girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers  
the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n  y  actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator  
she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her  
also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington )  
he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him  
her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6  
he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex  
the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring  
it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting  
for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background  
in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting  
of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music

no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football  
rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory  
based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought  
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword  
luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film  
antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador  
accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village  
we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude

but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land  
help is needed quickly  
an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives  
after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory  
personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity  
nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th  
the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives  
of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors  
but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog  
he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ?

jack carter is as tough as tough guys come

i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen "" get carter "" i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie  
 "" get carter "" falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room  
you might call them the "" steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers  "" 
you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development  
they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at  
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral  
he believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn't die from a dwi accident  
carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid  
his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice  
stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself  
the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death  
he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well  
mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman )  
there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives  
i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible

-1,"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat  
so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut )  
my , how easily does the worm turn  
hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics  
at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included  
and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism    
boring  
although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness  
_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender  
these characters are about as generic as those descriptions  
in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat  
with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best )  
as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_  
what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? 
even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene  
dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault  
from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend  
but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film  
aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored "
-1,"anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless  
though good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script  
so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting  
this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops  
she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because "" the ways of england are the ways of the world )  
the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? )  
the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father , have i offended you in some way ? 
why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her  
meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma  
the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position  
she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices  
he , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other  
there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies  
it's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure  
anna then comes in and cries a bit  
the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer  
i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched  
this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren  
we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care  
this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998  
i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient "

granted , there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre-school humor , but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle  
it's a painful experience for anyone with a brain

but he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 , 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe  
why africa ? 
so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches ( "" look , the rhino's about to give birth ! "" )  
if that seems like hee-haw humor to you , by all means , see the movie  
if not , claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us  
obviously , there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie , like the first ace ventura film ( i use the word "" film "" only because it was filmed , not because there's any level of artistic merit  ) , a huge success

-1,"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release

the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' )  
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  
these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences  
it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line  
if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words

it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor

while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke  
he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions  
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character  
they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there  
it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis  
but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? 
enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience  
it's stupid , pointless and repetitive  
i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone "
-1,"breakdown is an moderately entertaining , if underwhelming , thriller  
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor , taking the scenic route to california through redneck country  
however , while in the middle of nowhere , their jeep decides to break down , leaving them stranded  
a friendly truck driver , warren ( walsh ) , offers to give them a lift to town  
although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears  
jeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife  
although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are far superior character and script wise  
kurt russell is o  k as jeff , although he can seemingly only pull of one expression , which is angry  
throughout the whole film , he looks angry ( or just pissed off  ) 
quinlan is o  k again , but again she can only pull off one expression , which is looking dorky  
throughout the whole film , she looks dorky  
j  t walsh ( who , sadly , recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty weak , and not really menacing enough  
the supporting cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers  
the story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o  k , if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid  
some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy  
there are some flaws with the plot also , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention "
-1,"sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking  
take this film , "" naked killer "" , among it's ingredients are heavy doses of violence , rape sequences , straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls "" coarse language ""  
but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ? 
one word - penis  
that's it  
in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is "" penis  ""  
it really restores you're faith in the system , huh ? 
anyway , that's just a side point  
when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne , it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip , cool , controversial thriller  
what they forgot to mention was that it isn't very good  
the plot involves male cop tinam ( simon yam ) , investigating a series of brutal murders  
while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty ( chingmy yau ) , who , after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father , falls in with professional killer sister cindy ( svenwara madoka )  
realising kitty has potential , cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity  
however in the course of his investigation tinam ( who believed kitty had disappeared ) , runs into her again , but isn't quite sure if it's her  
to complicate matters the actual serial killlers , princess and baby , who a former students of cindy , and have been told to kill their old master and her new student  
from then the action ensues    
all in all , this is not a well done movie  
the script is awful , the direction all over the place , the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor  
however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain "
-1,"maybe this mission should have been scrubbed 
mission to mars 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
there's a world of difference between artists and technicians  
the artist has a vision to create something new  
he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before  
a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox  
obviously successful films need both skills  
brian de palma is a masterful technician  
he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock  
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote  
aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead  
in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick  
to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 ""  
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters ""  
nasa has set its sights for mars  
when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet  
they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe  
and it's all so boring  
there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin  
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching  
error  
the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off "

even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times  
comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge  
not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses  
this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess )  
henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey  
 ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films  ) 
how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me  
adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 )  
boston has changed dramatically in those ten years  
it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors  
some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it  
so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him  
that's it  
76 minutes never seemed so long  
this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie  
the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character  
the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight  
a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston  
in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son "
-1,"dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) , murphy returns in this abysmal comedy  
he plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals  
however , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt  ) 
however , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and 'comedy' is ready and waiting to happen  
except comedy never does happen  
doctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh  
poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers  
the manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's  
the voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie  
sadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb  
and they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb  
the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs  
there are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between  
if i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him  
sadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time  
joke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor  
the director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films  
she bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this  
the scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done  
the animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets "
-1,"a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr  , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like "" head over heels , "" "" boys and girls , "" "" down to you "" and "" she's all that  "" 
while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not  
i first saw him in the independent dark comedy "" the house of yes , "" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families  
prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes  
 "" summer catch "" certainly won't help his case  
inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time  
the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star  
ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team  
it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates  
the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like "" bull durham , "" but haven't got a clue how to get there  
and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes  
the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas  
in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from "" buffy the vampire slayer , "" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , "" he does have a nice ass  
a bubble butt  "" 
when lillard gives him an "" are you insane ? "" 
look , blucas calmly says , "" it's nothing sexual , "" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's  
speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie  
the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots  
blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film  
sick of hearing teammates make "" fat chick "" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies "

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
 "" quick , robin ! 
the anti-shark repellant ! "" 
- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg 
i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard  
this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill  
batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss  
by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast  
the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life  
meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone )  
akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement  
it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison  
i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production  
joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance  
there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode  
another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons  
mr  schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective  
it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered  
is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? 
i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously  
 ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" 
each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory "
-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie  
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion  
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on  
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects  
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie  
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms  zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original  
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones  
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it  
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients "
-1,"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie  
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock  
i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art  
no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already  
i thought : it's about these two cops  
and they're buddies , sort of  
they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other  
and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots  
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship  
and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying  
and the bad guy is a drug lord  
and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way  
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down  
i only missed the bit about the badges  
the rest i got dead-on  
and i hadn't even left the video store yet  
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo  
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l  is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds  
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man "" "
-1,"the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z  randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes  
 "" it wasn't me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  
well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either  
fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth  
as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa  
when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void  
  
  
fred  
yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known  
for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park  he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play  
his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records  
overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist  
from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence  
you know , standard kid movie material  
almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role  
we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it  
while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable "
-1," "" deep rising "" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films  
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "" anaconda "" -- "" deep rising "" has no tongue to put in its cheek  
folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases  
most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen "" titanic , "" then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature  
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members  
a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby  
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful  
the main problem with "" deep rising "" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory  
the concept is "" leviathan "" meets "" titanic , "" with a dash of "" speed 2 "" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) 
measure  
this monster is equal parts "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" and "" the relic , "" knows how to open doors like the raptors from "" jurassic park "" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in "" anaconda  "" 
some of the attack sequences are straight out of "" jaws "" and "" alien  "" 
a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of "" alien resurrection  "" 
there's even a jet ski chase like "" hard rain  "" 
and the list goes on  
watching "" deep rising "" 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy  
williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable  
an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as "" goldeneye "" 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j  o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast  
djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's "" amistad , "" pops up in a brief part  
he needs to stay away from the water "
-1,"for "" original sin , "" the road to the screen has been rocky  
initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001  
advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands  
so is "" original sin "" really all that bad ? 
yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards  
the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" )  
more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad  
veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films  
most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the "" let's go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable  
but things are different this summer  
quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may  
 "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls , "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along  
the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , "" mississippi mermaid "" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny  
the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , "" this is not a love story , it is a story about love  "" 
wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers  
a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children

-1,"august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to see slaughtered against family-oriented thanksgiving films  
last year , the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon , and this year , they bestow max keeble's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country  
parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did  
don't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a "" ment "" away from being a fetish film , isn't that entertaining  
in fact , you'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc  , harry potter ) come out next month  
but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy , then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it )  
we first see young max keeble ( alex d  linz , home alone 3 ) as a pint-sized superhero , delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross , foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man ( jamie kennedy , jay and silent bob strike back ) and landing the neighborhood honey ( brooke anne smith ) , who , by the way , is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day  
the scenario is , of course , a dream  
max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude , no luck with the ladies and only two friends , both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts ( and who were both in snow day ) - the perpetually robed robe ( josh peck ) and a clarinet-playing cutie named megan ( summer catch's zena grey ) , who harbors secret feelings for max  
things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school  
he has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of polar-opposite bullies ( noel fisher and orlando brown ) , and an illiterate principal ( larry miller , the princess diaries ) who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program  
when max's father ( grownup nerd robert carradine ) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week , max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off  
whoa - don't worry , parents  
he doesn't do it klebold-harris style  
it's all pretty tame stuff , but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move , leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings  
director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise   "
-1,"it should have been a classic  
a great cast of respected supporting actors  
an interesting premise of loser comic book characters  
however , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999  
the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals  
the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise  
the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all  
the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons  
they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film  
 "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business  
but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought  
thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie  
the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy  
the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city  
captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity  
after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured  
it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day  
by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low  
there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention  
the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down "
-1,"i'll be the first to admit it  
when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened    i'll 
gonna tell it the way i remember it  "" 
anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult )  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs  joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper )  
the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s  
finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects )  
during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro )  
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film  
and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress "

-1,"a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars  
what is the point of this ? 
i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far  
to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace  
wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time  
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight  
many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game  
i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie  
it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though  
freddie prinze jr  stars in the film as christopher blair  
wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie  
this was definitely his worst performance to date  
after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed  
 ( for now anyway  ) 
christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth  
blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there  
his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this  
blair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard  
matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too

-1,"starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz 
permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this  
the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity  
 ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit  ) 
ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself  
ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l  a  with ambition and a nasty drug habit  
he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr  chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons  
insert proverbial downward spiral here  
permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story  
i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive  
as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer  
what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy  
watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! 
watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! 
stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie  
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless  
when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? 
and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? 
in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself  
if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made "

a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes  
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  
it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience  
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely  
it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here  
it's not even fun as trash  
woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police  
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout

and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them

-1,"if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then "" bully "" 's for you  
based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , "" bully "" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood  
the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers  
in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( "" kids "" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities  
in terms of the incident and what provoked it , "" bully "" stirs up nothing new  
the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane  
the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department  
he hounds and harries and humiliates his "" best friend "" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby  
simply remove him from the equation  
marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off  
there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment  
they did it because they wanted to , and because they could  
what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material  
not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in "" bully "" but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it  
gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in "" there's something about mary "" look like the height of subtlety ! )  
clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about  
the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera  
the conclusion of "" bully "" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime  
it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it  
 "" bully "" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death "
-1,"according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors "" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness  "" 
hmm  
you never know , they just might be on to something  
what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  
but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  
it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  
that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  
woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson  
the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  
the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  
it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  
mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand  
then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  
he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  
so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way  
with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's    
dumb and dumber  
yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle "
-1,"ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too  
 "" she's all that "" has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year  
and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad

 "" she's all that "" tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr  ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular  
that , right there , is problem #1  
how many times have we seen this storyline ? 
as cook comments near the end of the film , "" it's kind of like "" pretty woman "" , except without the prostitution ""  
of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward  
as it is , though , "" she's all that "" relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead  
there's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured  
the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible  
i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said  
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was  
i was never convinced that she was a "" nerd "" , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary  
the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are

he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character

-1,"actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
 "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen  
at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions  
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention  
the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says  
 ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say  ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think )  
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but don't call her "" babe  "" 
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times

nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel  
the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout "" boo  "" 
fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson )  
marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history  
he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants  
taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead  
for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings  
her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch  
as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her  
unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer  
theo's assessment of the house ? 
 "" i love it ! 
sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters  "" 
who on earth would say that in place of "" citizen kane meets the munsters "" ? 
 ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) 
both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland  
as luke puts it , dr  marrow pulls the old "" academic bait and switch "" on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused  
later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout "" nell "" repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name )  
why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? 
the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti  
his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still  
i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house  
eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically "

sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team  
 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
 "" my name is jerry  
i am happy "" flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad

-1,"an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels  
it's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting  
harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime  
his luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition  
she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe )  
at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% )  
but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm  
palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together  
it's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers  
sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial  
a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations  
even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story  
some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation )  
the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more  
woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist  
elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role  
chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth  
some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances  
and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow  
as the movie grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto "

arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five  "" 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube  
 "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either )  
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience  
i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook "

-1,"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved  
some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts  
 "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep  
but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while  
it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy  
eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while  
and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be  
 "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series  
that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun  
eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people  
the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch  
in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble  
his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously  
eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way  
murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator  
in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up  
murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor  
the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim

-1,"a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom  
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny  
the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story  
pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face  
the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off  
this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will  
the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook  
to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure  
she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love  
in other words , she has to be in control of things  
in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him  
they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he's a loafer  
one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco  
we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane  
she visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr  ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene  
to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again  
her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show

-1,"it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried  
the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be  
ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold  
blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks  
co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe  
the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion  
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict  
obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues  
the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close  
there are forced messages here and there : "" go forward ; always go forward , "" lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago  
the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie  
the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any  
by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater  
the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? 
contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film  
although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place  
ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her  
so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? 
the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's  
the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully  
also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely  
and then there's the music "
-1,"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list  
what an auspicious beginning ! 
welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l  a  and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere  
firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies  
as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers  "" 
we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan  "" 
having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest  
when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble  
with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles  
not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people  
miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away  
in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building  
as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f  windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face  
our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl  
in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames  
the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse  
this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make  
the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group "
-1,"first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great  
a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring  
an orginal plot that grows old real fast  
one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through  
men in black has defied the odds  
when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas  
however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie  
tommy lee jones and will smith play two "" government "" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society  
the ridiculous plot begins when an alien "" bug "" , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on "" orion's belt  "" 
anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth  
the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn't like this film  
i love original plots  
this one had an original one  
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films  
whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while  
while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough  
and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really  
and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? 
a sentimental moment in an alien movie ? 
nice try , but i don't think so  
it doesn't work here  
it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience "

-1,"the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time  
unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact  
from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising  
it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people  
when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital  
in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people  
so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school  
right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable  
he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry  
shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter )  
they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people  
once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school  
patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court  
it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor  
i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it  
it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie  
considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother  
not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama  
robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels  
but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average "
-1,"capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi  
simmer for 100 minutes  
yields : zilch  
the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud  
it's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully  
the phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful  
it's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try  
the film opens up with a "" prelude "" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out  
we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from "" sorcerer "" as well ! 
sorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain  
both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go  
anyway , the cinematic theft doesn't stop there  
or at least the lack of inspiration  
there isn't a single thing here we haven't seen , and it's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest  
we have ( where's my list ? ) 
a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr  
no than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself  
what else is there ? 
the plot is a waste of time  
the sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey  
there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure once mike and the 'bots get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked  
the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another  
all i can say is that i pray this isn't the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie "
-1," "" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling  
it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill  
there are certainly better things you can do with your time  
actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments  
the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer  
but he's afflicted with loser-itis  
dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him  
truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun  
this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him  
we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor  
however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs  
as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed  
he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah  
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation  
with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him  
however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges  
goats beware ! 
he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies  
what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich  
equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black  
 "" it's reverse racism , "" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything "

taiwan , 24/12/99  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap  
this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that  
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background  
instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's  
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room  
this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways  
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole  
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication "

the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out  
while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence  
that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line  
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene  
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that  
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  
and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it  
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires  
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans  
this has not always been carpenter's style  
his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question  
jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows  
in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is  
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin )  
to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust  
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico  
if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is "
-1," "" lake placid "" marks yet another entry in the series of "" predator pics "" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- "" jaws "" ) and were revived recently by the godawful "" anaconda  "" 
 "" placid "" claims to be a "" horror/comedy "" -it's directed by the same guy who did "" house "" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of "" anaconda  "" 
paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake  
discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson )  
they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them  
along the way , the merry band meets mrs  delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake  
you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while "" jaws "" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist  
unlike its slippery cousin "" anaconda , "" "" lake placid "" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating  
the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious  
while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of "" friday the 13th "" and "" halloween h20 "" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like "" ally mcbeal "" and "" chicago hope "" ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick  
the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it  
 ( "" lake placid "" manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself )  
the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course  
like the snake in "" anaconda , "" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural  
 "" lake placid "" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine  
there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how "" we really don't know much about crocodiles  "" 
they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers  
a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? 
creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on  
pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot "

fails to impress 
based on the popular 50's sitcom , sgt  
bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever  
remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? 
 ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped )  
i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success  
such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie  
sgt  
bilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain  
sgt  ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter  
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools  
though materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that  
colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it  
bilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds  
to add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days  
director jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt

-1," "" nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy "" 
showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence  
some people , however , keep their clothes on  
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them  
that's why this review will be short  
it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores  
there is no story , script , point or acting  
only naked bodies , which is exactly the point  
here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile  
no one is twisting nomi's arm  
no one is holding her grandmother hostage  
she wants to do this  
and that is what she is doing till the end credits  
so what's the problem then ? 
what's the point ? 
what's the film about ? 
is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? 
this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck  
believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody  
elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script  
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better  
her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public  
 "" i am not a whore ! 
i am a dancer "" , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing  
in fact the acting in "" showgirls "" brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level  
not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning "
-1,"one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film  
after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave  
he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing  
however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year  
the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation  
these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly  
it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it's only when things are over that they make sense  "" 
whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided  
the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone  
instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last  
only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it  
but don't fret , it will surface again  
you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile  
but you hold hope for some time  
the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations  
it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope  
and with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? 
to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene  
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful  
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him  
and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities "

the story , you ask ?

i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
in this respect , the film never disappointed me  
this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane  
the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think )  
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face  
thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with

in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet  
i guess that i was expecting the former going in  
the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant  
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience  
chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen )

just want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda  
it's not even worth a 99-cent video rental  
don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) 
btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper )  
now i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing  
here goes : 
movie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night  
even then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) 
why do i hate anaconda ? 
let me count the ways    
first of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong  
as an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises  
whew  
i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it  
unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel  
my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end  
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually  
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep

-1,"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard  
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun  
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters  
and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review  
thrillers are all variations on a theme  
you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet  
you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process  
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner  
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror     
is anyone else getting depressed here ? 
point is , it's not enough to follow the formula  
you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version  
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails  
that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f

richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal "

they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season )  
combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film  
howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground )  
in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire  
william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak  
he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby  
his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him  
soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters  
why canadian ? 
who knows , eh ? 
along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage  
enter howie long  
he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help  
when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage  
long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much  
although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better  
the script doesn't help him out any , however  
all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny  
the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable

-1,"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident  
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail  
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of  
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know  
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
film is a different medium  
it is a visual medium  
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize

the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner  
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film  
it really verges on being tedious at least at times  
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects  
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it  
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco  
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking  
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs  
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?

-1,"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role  
not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation  
and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence  
sure  
william baldwin isn't a bad actor  
unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie  
i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good  
if it was the latter , it worked  
cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie  
which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement  
although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places  
so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? 
well , i'm glad you asked that question  
cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents  
why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? 
by the end of the movie you won't care  
the story is so contrived it isn't funny  
anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin  
who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films )  
the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud  
the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes  
if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears "

visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear "
-1,"porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years  
they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country  "" 
 "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" )  
after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty's next "" ishtar  "" 
so , is it that bad ? 
the answer is no  
but it's not very good either  
the major problem with "" town and country "" is that it's unstructured and random  
stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski )  
next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin  
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples' divorce lawyer )  
ellie thinks she's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family's mississippi manse  
the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they'd never become a couple to begin with  
back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter's cheating on her  
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he's gay  
the four friends , along with every woman porter's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after  
although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere  
the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home  
after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son  
porter's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled  
once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm "
-1," "" you damn dirty apes ! "" 
that's just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that's taken on a comedic context over time  
no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston's acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this "" mystery science theater 3000 "" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others  
it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes    
the list goes on  
heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth  
the thing is , on this planet humans can't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species  
heston's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned  
he surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man  
believe me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years  
when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god "" created ape in his image  "" 
but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president  
and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , "" if humans couldn't speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! "" 
and how do you account for your acting ability , mr  heston ? 
the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie's surprise conclusion  
i won't reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling "" god damn you all to hell ! "" 
several times in succession  
the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them  
what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution  
but let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ? 
ape : but  "
-1,"everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals  ' 
in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience  
the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches  
dr  susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches  
the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone  
'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill  
the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case     it's 
humans  
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs  
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace  
perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become  
if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest  
the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie  
there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking  
if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense  
in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better "
-1,"woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker  
in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy  
from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles  
some of these work better than others  
zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist  
deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back  
harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives  
he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing  
the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments  
perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out  
as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises  
the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life  
these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters  
it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person  
if that sounds complicated , it is  
then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image  
harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time  
as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order  
if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable  
but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand "
-1,"with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well  
with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining  
however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere  
this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment  
considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing  
the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors  
however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft  
along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber  ) 
they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens  
unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere  
the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier  
the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on  
the actors and directing don't help , either  
hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie  
stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman  
the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere  
but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone  
the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through  
the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action  
the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) 
the writing doesn't help much , either "

yes , in terms of acting , the star power is  
  
  
well , more like a falling star  
kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead  
lost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name  
it's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population  
john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet  
earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years  
john's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham )  
despite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space  
unknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission  
dr  smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr  smith has re-programmed a talking robot to "" destroy robinson family "" ! 
when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete  
as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground  
it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? 
chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium  
if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! 
that's just her normal voice ! 
in yet another example of a "" friend "" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod "
-1,"two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit "" what is love ? "" 
while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub  
it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature  
emphasis on the word "" presumably  "" 
_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels  
the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits  
with "" what is love ? "" 
blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out "" hotties "" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts  
there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak  
that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters  
the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends  
there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots  
the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club  
there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs  
meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing  
when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two  
the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is  
the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end  
alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film  
granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration  
that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves  
like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context "

fun ? 
exciting ? 
challenging ? 
given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff , pistol packin' babe who raids , well    
tombs , you have to believe it's these three things and more ! 
 "" lara croft : tomb raider , "" the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for "" girl , interrupted "" no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things  
it isn't fun , it isn't exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark )  
directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to "" con air , "" "" tomb raider "" is an empty-headed , big budget bore  
the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys "" hudson hawk "" ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well    
who the heck cares ? ) and it makes "" super mario bros  "" ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like "" rocco and his brothers "" ( that classic of italian neo-realism )  
i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper  
this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms  croft hails from england's green and pleasant )  
with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough  
ok , let's forget challenging  
shouldn't "" tomb raider "" be , at the very least , fun and exciting ? 
shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ? 
there's no humor to be found anywhere in "" tomb raider , "" even though it tries hard from time to time  
even "" the mummy returns "" didn't take itself too seriously  
the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent "

-1,"boy , what a great movie ! ! 
keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot

all die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on  
ol "" much ado about nothing "" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago  
to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university  
by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics  
this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in  
a potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost  
surely nobody could have any problems with that ? 
morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor  
he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public  
he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly  
so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location  
unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script  
this movie is just dying for a comparison with "" the fugitive ""  
both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere  
the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward  
credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters  
where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop  
it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while  
harrison ford was "" the man against the world  "" 
he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well "

mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff  "" 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ? 
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality

in order for studios to survive , they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used  
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary

-1," "" with all that education , you should know what happiness is  "" 
starring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung 
every country has , eventually , its new wave  
france had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on  
some waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery  
taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling  
jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age  
at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc "
-1,"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony  
naturally , this got me worried  
would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? 
if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in  
if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel  
unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm  
carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman  
as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else  
the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler  ) 
hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead  
plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose  
although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film  
carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped  
it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script  
the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story  
also , major events , such as mr  cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened  
the story is a bit of a mess , frankly  
the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest  
her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on  
she looks nice , though "

an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession  
it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get  
i learned that the word "" bitch "" is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used  
it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing  
they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money  
it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place  
this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears  
these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face  
the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite  
also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life  
we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd  
they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money  
these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves  
 "" priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp  
 "" doctors need nurses  
so ho's need pimps  '' 
as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors  
the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human  
while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community "

-1,"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan  
directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , 
 "" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible  
one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck  
a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water  
these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements  
except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be  
in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims  
 "" house on haunted hill "" doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think  
this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film  
 "" house on haunted hill "" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest  
the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot  
the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem  
however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable  
the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush )  
each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money  
since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them  
the problem is that every character is not likable  
the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter )  
the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them  
the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett "
-1,"there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of "" scream queen "" in the early '80s  
two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween  
the same "" god , i'm scared , there's some guy in a mask coming after me "" routine she did in john carpenter's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense  
terror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education  
most of them won't make it to med school , though , and it's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , "" i wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train  "" 
the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee  
from the beginning , he's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers "" think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? "" 
as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles  
of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it  
i forgot to mention the prologue  
it's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students  
two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he's going to get laid  
they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed  
she says , "" kiss me , kenny , "" and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver  
 ( "" oh my god , they killed kenny ! 
you bastards ! "" ) 
it's a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn't let in on  
she still hasn't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( "" you asshole , you can't have a good time without hurting somebody ! "" )  
the killing starts before the train even leaves the station  
since it's new year's , everyone's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one's looking  
at least one of the characters says it's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie  
speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield "" as the magician , "" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music  
then there's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that "
-1,"the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie , but , alas , no caped crusader descends to save * this * film  
instead , it's a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of "" dr  
jekyll and mr  hyde  "" 
for a few , fleeting , maddening moments , director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone , the colors , the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martin's best-selling novel  
yet it fizzles too quickly ; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene  
casting is a large part of the problem  
the story all but collap- ses around ms  roberts-- she doesn't have the range for this kind of drama  
her accent also comes and goes , though it's nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich  
 ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that's missed by everyone in the story ! ) 
the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts  
glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon  
her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions  
the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none  
no terror , no tension ; nothing  
without any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig's fabulously dreary production design  
all of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving  
 ( the pacing in the second-half is especially abominable  
if you * do * stick it through , your sole reward is a half-hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation  )

-1,"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask  
i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series  
however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs  data  
somewhere along the line , the "" star trek "" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction  
its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters  
generations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t  kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name  
no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy  
among those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr  soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world  
seventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart )  
soran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains  
i don't think it is an insult to fans of "" star trek "" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a "" trek "" film  
it's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy  
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen  
data ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing  
in the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year  
what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? 
he doesn't get a joke  
once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know "
-1,"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything  
a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l  jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with  
it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why  
right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible  
a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead  
after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial  
mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics  
the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have  
sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box  
the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part  
i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact  
there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this  
because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting  
one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic  
i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter  
the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes  
first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma  
he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade  
the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story "

the drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action  
back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see "" the philadelphia story "" for a great farce  
 "" town & country "" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels  
but , there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is "" t&c's "" downfall  
there is , obviously , a great deal of hollywood talent , in front of and behind the camera , involved in "" town & country , "" but , without a likable or , at least , interesting story to carry through their efforts , it is all for naught  
and , that's what we get here - naught  
porter stoddard ( beatty ) is a high-powered new york architect with a very good life indeed  
his 25-year marriage to ellie ( diane keaton ) appears , on the surface , to be perfect  
but , there are cracks just below this pristine surface  
his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts , his kids don't need him and his best friends , griffin ( garry shandling ) and mona ( goldie hawn ) , are in the midst of a divorce  
porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper  
at the 90-minute mark of "" town & country "" i asked myself , "" what's the point ? "" 
i wasn't entertained , i laughed three times - over silly little pratfalls - and spent most of the film marking time 'til the end  
warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog , making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head  
keaton's ellie is an empty headed flake who can't see the obvious as porter screws around on her  
and , as you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ? 
the supporting cast is given nothing to do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use  
nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling  
the actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air-headed musician and the character doesn't belong , anyway  
jenna elfman is a sweet , but smart , ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures

the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy  
the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial  
filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster  
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed

the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love  
then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart  
why ? 
well , because they have to  
otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after  
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic  
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead  
a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat  
the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well  
stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair )  
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film  
you know , the average porn star  
the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes

-1,"as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times  
but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber  
it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything  
the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful  
this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor  
well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded  
along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber  
thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience  
the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own  
this is there strictly for the kids  
the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs  
although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone  
the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible  
admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor )  
the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable  
the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? 
this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance  
as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie  
giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof  brainard's flying robot weebo  
giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie "

-1,"running time approximately 1hr 40mins 
reviewed by jack choo 
rating : 
the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come  
the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red  
existenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game  
supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality  
 * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz  
players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience  
during a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law )  
 * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt  
as they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected  
existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him  
even so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners  
not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly  
existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up  
while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot  
in existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else  
jennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film  
the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category  
it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) 
which is actually quite good  
existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times  
10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg "

mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened ? 
why is spawn so bad ? 
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film  
i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc  spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath )  
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero "
-1,"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits  
the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is  
last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory  
in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer  
whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller  
julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr  ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion  
julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle )  
will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics  
unfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook  
it's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending  
there's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel  
for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer  
the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing  
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments  
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point  
the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem  
and , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically  
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "" the killer  "" 
they're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show "
-1,"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? 
done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema  
unfortunately , it isn't  
with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep  
fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis  
his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest  
he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen  
this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths  
at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own  
meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life  
he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey  
it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be  
on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film  
however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids  
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer  
if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie  
the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos  
the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc  ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here  
the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather  
they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie "

-1,"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief   
however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies  
it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by  
even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel  
firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement  
he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman  
as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases  
i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started  
but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van  
with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road  
jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars  
but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town  
the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars  
director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience  
but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect  
hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par  
not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected  
such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations  
strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta  
we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character "
-1,"i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago  
i guess my memory really sucks  
there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack  
the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great  
caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club  
michael o'keefe plays said caddy  
why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me  
the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera  
the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course  
most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success  
bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted  
the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing  
there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie  
i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid  
i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper  
nothing about this movie works  
it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly  
most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny  
it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world  
i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny "
-1,"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates  
frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement  
unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller  
almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities  
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled  
unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening  
this is a very bad sign  
not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder  
of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters  
a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling )  
emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas )  
their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen )  
when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband  
instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily  
 ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest  ) 
ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair  
not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting  
 ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't  ) 
steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes  
the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks "
-1,"i think we should , as responsible citizens , all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie  
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst  
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues , epilogues , etc  the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day  
ho , ho  
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr  
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable  
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing  
grinding doesn't begin to describe  
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that , if you are a normal person , you leave feeling sick  
when it's not trying to be funny , it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying , stupid and sappy  
at best  
this movie is intended to make people laugh , yes , not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound  
but , it fails on every possible level  
it fails to be funny  
it fails to be insightful  
it fails to be suspensful  
it fails to be fun

-1,"sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and "" pushing tin "" certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people  
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has "" hip comedy "" written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing "" you have to be joking "" situations  
etc  
in "" pushing tin , "" thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly  
from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , "" quirky "" credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for "" the full monty , "" let alone won it  
but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet  
so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game  
hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick "" the zone "" falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz  
of course  
until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space  
boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins  
it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other  
oh no  
there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? 
director mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before  
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe  
they'll make you frown in disbelief  
they'll have you constantly looking at your watch  
but wait ! 
there's still 100 minutes to go ! ! 
the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes  
this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( "" oscar and lucinda "" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( "" elizabeth "" )

-1,"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us  
if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie  
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film  
but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film  
for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers  
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well  
unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers  
that title would be the confusing  
ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly  
it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb  
liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth  
the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money  
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film  
first , the house is great- looking  
it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot  
it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it  
this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film  
things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight  
haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie  
the hill house is not eerie "
-1,"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival  
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival  
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time  
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart  
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it  
something else is what he did  
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life  
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep  
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada  
she wants to build a career as an actress  
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow  
she does not know who the woman is  
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is  
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not  
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own  
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george )  
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong  
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion  
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits "
-1,"possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk  
it smashed u  s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here  
but is it any good ? 
in a word , no  
i'll elaborate further  
the story is as follows  
apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on  
one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened  
 ( see jurrasic park  ) 
imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago  
realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island  
enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there  
so , basically , what you have is this  
two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them  
a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem  
it's crap  
over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky  
add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested  
it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? ' 
 ( yes , you should )  
it's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park "

gibson plays porter , a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger , in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist  
as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter's back , porter miraculously springs back to life  
he makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot  
 ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000 haul  ) 
in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory "" operation "" )  
helgeland's film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm  
the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone  
payback should have been called playback : it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence  
 ( mel : "" i want my money  "" 
anonymous villain : "" no  "" 
mel shoots gun  
anonymous villain dies  
mel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello )  
second verse , same as the first  ) 
it's not porter's single-mindedness that robs the film of snap , crackle , and pop ; as a character who has already "" died "" once , he has nothing to lose and so much to gain  
the movie lacks danger  
the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep  
payback has a gritty , metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months  
 ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig "

i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl  
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries  
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways  
it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing  
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy

meanwhile , cab's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin  
>from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between  
those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story  
only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours  
for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing  
appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors  
blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie  
many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don't have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you'll be bored out of your skull "
-1,"there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact  
i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release  
the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes  
deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking  
the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense  
the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail  
how do we know this ? 
because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading  
ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie  
successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots  
television is what's wrong with deep impact  
the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy  
she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area  
when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps  
 "" i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being  "" 
she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet  
upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question  
and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star  
leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth "
-1,"if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! 
indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them  
it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film  
but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show  
what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? 
first , the movie gives us an introductory premise  
huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared  
oooh    scary ! 
secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score  
third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams )  
he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy  
finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him  
they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are  
during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs  
spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way  
little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster  
yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds  
this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film  
their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat  
those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed "

-1,"how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel "" the princess diaries "" be anything but cute , harmless fun ? 
easy  
take all the cute , harmless fun out of it  
and while you're at it make it borrr-ring  
that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film "" the princess diaries  "" 
you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass  of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me )  
well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious  
too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other "" princess "" movies-- "" pretty woman "" and "" runaway bride "" --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem )  
in addition to being predictable as molasses , "" the princess diaries "" has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition )  
marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working    
and hardly * any * of "" the princess diaries "" works ( "" works , "" alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either )  
newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule "" genovia "" ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads )  
julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan )  
does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? 
not really  
consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets  
also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( "" welcome to the dollhouse "" 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection  
a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product  
lame , labored , and lamentable , "" the princess diaries "" is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and "" the perfect storm "" ) "

year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt  
bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last  
i thought stripes would be different  
with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army  
instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army  
murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him  
so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever  
the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette  
all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular  
he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters  
he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud  
as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it  
i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition "" dear god ! "" 
every few seconds  
stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either  
most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m  p  
onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the "" aunt jemima treatment , "" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly

-1,"for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame  
despite it's lurid subject matter and it's passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film  
freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life  
they have a beautiful house in suburbia  
jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm  
jasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree  
in an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs  
this is a couple that has it all  
into this eden slithers the lure of lust  
despite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person  
a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine's concerns  
we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine's dismay  
as jermaine puts it , "" don't you want to be sexually free ? "" 
jermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter  
the woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine  
jade , at one point was a college student , too  
unlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet  
to further reinforce their differences , it's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son  
inevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine's part , the forbidden act is consummated  
the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine's property with the hint that the violence may escalate  
by this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance "
-1,"the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story  
the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  
however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device  
those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed  
mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism  
the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow  
i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible  
once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect  
while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense  
the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure  
unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death  
the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player  
soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them  
along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens )  
why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? 
apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called "" mercury  "" 
to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds' puzzle magazine  "" 
of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is  
when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa  
as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course  
but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has "
-1,"contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece  
some of them aren't even good  
some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful "" un indien dans la ville "" ( presented as "" little indian , big city , "" and remade into that crap tim allen flick , "" jungle2jungle "" ) , and this  
what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick  
 "" french twist "" ( the "" cool "" american title , not the real one , which was "" gazon maudit , "" literally meaning "" twisted ground , "" or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them  
loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married  
always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out  
and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off  
so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo  
but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat  
so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both  
she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself  
after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel  
the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! ) 
ending  
i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad  
none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in "" fargo "" ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience  
what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars )  
the writing and directing is really the big problem with it  
josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all

critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending  
it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us  
it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark "" junkyard "" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever    ) , and all the sets look like     well ,

there is also absolutely no arc to this story  
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings  
gibson should stick to writing novels and "" x-files "" episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage  
some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask )  
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point  
i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was  
some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at

-1,"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass  
toss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it  
this , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans  
thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot )  
directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez  
paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young  
i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present  
for those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film  
the acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie  
grainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it  
confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story  
quite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us  
why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? 
another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her  
in retaliation , she bites off part of his finger  
this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood  
the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner  
one , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body  
the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten  
certainly she had to endure a miserable life  
but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good "
-1,"shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen  
it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies  
that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort  
shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work  
the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books  
philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london  
it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan  
however , to directly quote the film , he has "" cash flow problems  "" 
through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts  
so , mr  henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production  
however , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well  
he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper  
then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block  
there are many other little issues that mr  henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing  
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author  
ironically , that couldn't be truer here  
the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors  
one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love "

-1," "" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney  
it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless  
what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film  
hypothetically , i mean  
 "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ? 
the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show-stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse  
the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded  
in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning  
doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? 
anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss  "" 
philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j  barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to  
through a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough  
a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again )  
and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him  
yuckity-yuck  
what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is  
you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up  
earlier in '97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much  
disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively  
in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic  "" 
such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh "

he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour  
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food

the result ? 
william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure  
though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure  
the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds  
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on  
and filming the dialogue in voice over

there are three good things about lost and found  
the first is spade  
the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie  
lastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary  
unfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute  
this kind of physical humor is dead  
pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel  
this is where i start to get fuzzy  
also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila  
given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow  
and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? 
predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated  
david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing "
-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent  
it would be derisive  
it would be glib  
it would be dismissive  
it would be entirely accurate  
rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging  
the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous  
the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables  
despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities  
consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent  
louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene  
 ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand  ) 
meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice  
serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky  
it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest  
it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr  d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr  lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr "
-1,"kids today , they don't just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr  loving on the ladies  
no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball  
through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there's no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention  
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a's , where he is hoping for his big break  
it's only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman's thong ( don't ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! 
 ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn't even bother    
but of course he makes a play for her  
summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan's non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas )  
worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that '70s show's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs  robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham  
in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it's been done better somewhere else  
for starters , the film has a major question of identity  
it's definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance  
the worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion  
by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart  
dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice  
coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint  
ryan's catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to "" play catch "" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy "
-1,"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller  
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  
writer steven e  desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little  
van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u  s  --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans  
it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter    
    which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_  
while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ )  
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" 
and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "" 
standing out among my favorites  
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs  
van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual  
early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way  
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug "
-1,"five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake  
the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! )  
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r  a  m  r  # 
1521 )  
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here  
orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two )  
yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too  
i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability  
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film  
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks  
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line  
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens  
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot  
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress  
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office  
i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible )  
the script for this film is completely pathetic "
-1,"cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins  
while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here  
the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i'll try my best and explain it as simply as possible  
the film is based on a "" mostly "" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down  
it's during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor  
between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated  
also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience  
tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out  
for robbin's it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits  
i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few  
let me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it's the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this )  
i'll begin with those involved with the play  
there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock  
outside the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack )  
there's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story  
anyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin  
now although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown  
sure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive  
the whole film is like this , and it's basically nothing but a headache  
on the brighter side , tim robbin's direction was masterful "
