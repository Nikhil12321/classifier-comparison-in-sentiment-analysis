1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution  
chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that  
just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim  
chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather  
guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy  
that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie  
prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt  
chris decides to leave her alone  
little does he realize what will happen next  
i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away )  
certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews  
story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife  
however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil  
a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life  
 "" we're soul mates ! "" 
chris exclaims  
heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love  
usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds  
but what dreams may come goes a different route  
it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before  
chris' heaven is his memories brought to life  
his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven  
 "" i've never seen anyone use real paint before , "" albert says  
equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone  
instead , it's a state of being  
in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his "" tracker "" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces  
thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else  
mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood  
it's truly a frightening sequence  
production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination  
using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration  
sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact  
it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it  
costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes  
cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects  
but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job  
writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects  
an hour into the film , the war begins  
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must )  
following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war  
the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else  
many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks  
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  
the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it  
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot  
it's about special effects and gory violence  
director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall  
verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood  
starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon  
the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it  
my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group  
the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women  
despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful  
while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear  
thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with  
the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you  
casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon  
to most guys , he will come across as artificial  
fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character  
dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character  
her dizzy is extremely likeable  
denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done  
jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film  
neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast  
however , he does give a good performance  
michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm  
his performance rises above the rest  
perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen  
unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars  
director verhoeven is the main star of the film  
his direction is fast and unrelentless "

1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge )  
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien  
however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  
and it has  
story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story )  
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it )  
the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot  
beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  
and it does it quite well  
the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do  
the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does  
there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects  
the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad  
but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children )  
also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off  
however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  
many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence  
however , i tend to disagree  
what were the alien films about ? 
and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? 
my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  
i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one )  
the acting is quite good for this kind of film  
it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least  
the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  
okay , so it isn't that good  
george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  
natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage  
however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  
oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch  
marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film  
michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality )  
james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor  
as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability  
mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel  
and , of course , justin lazard  
lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective  
sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ? 
the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting  
species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language  
this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see "

1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence  
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally )  
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  
visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline  
but don't be fooled    
little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it  
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again  
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel  
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date  
visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come  
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball  
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball  
however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe  
it's truly a great example of film making at its finest  
with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices  
the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover )  
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores    
do they ? )  
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body  
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) "

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  
each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching  
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well  
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  
stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  
we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here  
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  
the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction  
simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  
restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture  
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks  
designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right )  
added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers  
the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold  
it is a world that you want to walk around in  
norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape  
most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit  
andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones  
much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city ""  
reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating  
these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating  
but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms  
by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating  
although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself  
well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated  
granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be  
whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" )  
having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise  
the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original  
missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life  
 "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones  
this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on  
but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe  
hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality  
best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique  
it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not  
please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one  
but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best  
as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end  
sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness  
it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema "

1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them    
 "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows  
in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see    and 
it's often as funny as anything , too  
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at  
there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training    these 
schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  
but they're still hilarious as ever  
likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  
the really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu  
i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and 
it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it  
genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on  
come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films    it's 
not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , "" whoa    "" 
on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background  
 "" gone with the wind "" , this isn't  
still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot  
it's much more "" real "" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme  
you might very well like it  
another interesting thing about "" drunken master "" has to do with its video availability in the us  
 "" drunken master "" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 )  
there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase  
thankfully , "" drunken master "" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price  
if you like "" drunken master "" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad    if 
nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue )  
i particularly recommend "" spiritual kung fu "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , the "" fearless hyena "" movies , and "" snake & crane arts of shaolin "" "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
 ( title )    
a shot of an alien egg    
 ( title )    
alien legs stretch up into the air    
 ( title )    
and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  
it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  
of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  
after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated  
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  
featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s  dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise  
it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  
and this is where alien 3 succeeds  
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both )  
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  
by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  
many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived  
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  
however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die )  
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review  
>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  
in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach  
in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  
alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  
ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her  
why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending  
fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces "

1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )  
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you  
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less  
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  
the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all  
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again  
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that )  
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur  
it was at this point that i felt cheated  
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film  
everything occurs from his perspective  
he is our representation on screen ( sort of )  
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  
i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything  
it earned its r rating for a reason  
there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity  
this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything  
it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh  
however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those  
i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it  
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  
the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann  
portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  
this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  
she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  
something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature  
the story actually has something to say about humanity  
in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course )  
he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity  
then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature  
this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening  
what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true  
these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on )  
when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched  
the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect  
heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job  
probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves  
he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance  
i have never seen him more believable to date  
al pacino is of course the scene stealer  
his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things )  
he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term )  
jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon  
judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past  
connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable  
the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place )  
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own  
o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary )  
if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions )  
the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes ""  
for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  
originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number )  
most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  
the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews )  
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few )  
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  
the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  
the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  
when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  
once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  
the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab  
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc  
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  
former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the "" behind the music : rocky horror "" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung "" hot patootie ""  
the "" behind the music "" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot  
there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews  
as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  
one of which is just the "" superheroes "" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called "" once in a while ""  
a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants )  
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here "

1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    
for a hefty price  
ms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l  a  cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead  
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing  
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail  
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops  
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably  
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way  
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends  
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise  
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop  
of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it  
things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more  
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side  
on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film  
however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original  
the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive  
the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand  
his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time  
perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard  
the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized  
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good  
and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s  
the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable  
the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions  
nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on  
the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown  
her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film  
watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking  
her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought  
bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato  
i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights )  
michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen  
chris tucker has a small , but effective performance  
samuel l  jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical )  
but no matter    
jackson is very strong in his role  
robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends  
robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters  
he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier  
jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks  
as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in  
however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results "

1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality  
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them  
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke  
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other  
individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them  
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers  
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging  
many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining  
first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates  
the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council  
each location is elaborate and complex  
lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines  
most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made  
more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters  
the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves  
watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room  
of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable  
speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks  
with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy  
jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick  
jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble  
the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors  
however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing  
he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene  
throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence  
you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character  
initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film  
on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all  
a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates  
despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously  
fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art  
from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e  t  
in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed  
and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action  
from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil  
the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed  
the phantom menace won't win any major oscars  
it probably won't beat titanic's box office record  
and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  
it is a straightforward liberation through sex  
as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on  "" 
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions  
 "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says  
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face  
we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is  
 "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us  
beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness     
we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth  
who else has found it ? --the 
man of today ? -- "" i 
don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today     
this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay  
this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us  
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! 
as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say  
its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure  
for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice  
on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes  
it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it  
let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "" 
now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this  
sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever  
it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey  
as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory  
she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory  
upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else  
the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power  
let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle  
the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood  
also , jungian archetypes abound  
these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames "

1,"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8  50  
[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side  ' 
we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi )  
what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  
to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity  
also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  
most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  
for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least )  
with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights  
unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  
if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? )  
but i digress  
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself  
all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself  
what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s  
its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality  
the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times  
we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo  
we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly  
we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor )  
the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman )  
the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears  
he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series  
sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person  
clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers  
i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films )  
but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along  
the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another  
there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook  
the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting  
the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits  
as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story  
and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council  
to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation  
their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force  
jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves  
this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before  
in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before  
the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary  
by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot  
it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence  
not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history  
and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter  
it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society  
`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness  
so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain'  
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi  
the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return  
as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times  
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio  
bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream  
miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects  
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron  
by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department  
many of the studio's old men had retired or died  
therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film  
originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped  
the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it  
in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features  
but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million  
the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation  
the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective )  
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features  
as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron  
finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released  
because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? 
the people who had seen the film didn't think so  
in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it  
for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom  
few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat  
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g )  
somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states  
before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs  
those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version  
even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed  
some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't  
but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available  
as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all  
in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film  
much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ? 
the one that flopped at the box office ? 
the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ? 
this doesn't seem like all of the above  
instead , it's a classic in its own right  
the film has a wonderful cast of characters "

1,"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr  evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star'  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me  
ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers  
but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner  
robert wagner , as dr  evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character  
one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee  
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina )  
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny  
don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination     
of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression  
her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her  
and as for fat bastard    
well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far  
but my most severe complaint : mr  bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! 
but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that  
this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot  
and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection  
if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more

1,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film  
all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this  
teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell  
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces  
but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching  
it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end  
the two main characters are also the most interesting  
boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear  
his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood  
colqhoun is different  
he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul  
he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically  
it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen  
the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal  
completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer  
here time stands still , and nothing changes  
the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage  
they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life  
men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose  
the result is some sort of cabin fever  
cannibalism is more like a sick game for them  
since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying  
it's like "" who's going to die first ? "" 
the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's "" the shining ""  
it's hard to not get mad here ! 
one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers  
music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere  
a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation  
the director herself stated that it was "" ok to laugh "" during the picture  
and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : ""   it's 
lonely being a cannibal  
you don't get that many friends    "" 
or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying "" eat to live  
don't live to eat  "" )  but 
mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change  
every actor does a great job  
especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor  
this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire'  
actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike  
 "" ravenous "" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring  
however these little failures don't diminish the impression  
this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations  
it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always  
it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since "" the shining ""

1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  
bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims  
along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr  christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle )  
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words  
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character  
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film  
later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something  
but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly  
after all , it isn't shakespeare  
how about the cast ? 
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007  
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character  
judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role  
she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner  
robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie  
coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes  
then there are the bond girls  
sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today  
there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim  
those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face  
marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest  
then we have denise richards  
there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks  
and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes  
i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist  
admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely  
i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character  
while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me  
the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground  
i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character  
this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations  
last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q  this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever  
although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch  
rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role  
he says future appearances are up to a higher power  
the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese  
while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands  
so how does it stack up ? 
despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie  
and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies  
this is easily the best of the brosnan films  
it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3  
one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series  
here's looking forward to bond number 20 "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is  
this is pretty much just one trashy film  
however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch  
it's good trash , in a sense  
one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  
this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running  
bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs  
and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed  
wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries  
instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry    
it's not as graphic as you might think )  
the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene  
it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it  
and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too )  
also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it )  
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast  
neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  
here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl )  
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  
you can tell she will be around for a long time  
denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range  
here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers  
hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability  
and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies  
she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half  
towards the end she does get a bigger part  
on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist  
kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it  
you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen  
and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence )  
in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "" 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false  
in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark  
much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness  
mr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges  
and while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  
still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr  anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same  
in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard  
if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr  anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness  
there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights  
mr  anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect  
similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing "" i'm so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening  
boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good  
while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr  wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr  reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention  
mr  reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film  
i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee  
mr  reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation  
worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career  
mr  reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective  
ms  graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry  
consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp  
her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity  
 ( if only mr  anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) 
and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms  graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet  
draw your own conclusions  
perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr  cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion  
his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st  vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry  
while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable  
luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t  rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures  
jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns  
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company  
labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub )  
german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc  ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security  
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome  
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them  
unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried  
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  
the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit  
the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers  
as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future  
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  
the best thing , however , is the plot  
the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller  
at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present  
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring  
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? 
maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws  
if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? 
niccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa  
the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters  
while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story  
ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far  
his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and "" valid "" peers  
uma thurman is    well , uma thurman  
her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn't about her  
however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character  
jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character  
he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one  
loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character  
dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie  
alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank  
still , he does a good job  
gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film  
gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity  
despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty  
it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have  
if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently  
however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn't talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a )  
instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you 
did not have to die    no one should ever die    i 
will stop this   i 
promiss   "" 
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career  
after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death  
composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally  
with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation  
the result was ugliness  
realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late  
the creature has escaped  
because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding  
for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death  
but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously    
whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel  
brannagh has more or less done that  
another thing is characters and actors  
branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast  
the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro  
alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness  
at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love  
later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge  
he is capable of killing without regret  
 "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground     and 
then i slowly crushed his neck    and 
as i killed him , i saw your face   "" 
that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator  
and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : "" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all  "" 
rarely has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel  
another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein  
in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm  
almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel  
here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene "

1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry , 
make that 'roles' in the movie  
even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout  
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart  "" he mutters coldly  
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not  
that's what really makes this movie unique  
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though      that's 
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other     and 
never hit  
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again  
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant  
whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing  
joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife  
i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie    it 
would have wrecked her potrayal  
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend      make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends  
other movies would have used her character as just window dressing    a 
sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent  
dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's  
faults ? well    there were some i have to say "

-1,"well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you  
because thats all that there really is     
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity     
i am not saying that this isn't possible   
but it does leave one to wonder    i 
know i did  
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out     
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations  
there was one scene that should have been short    
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
ok enough already get on with it  
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do    
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort    
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning  
this movie is also very predictable    
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment   
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you  
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated    
it gets boring at times to tell you the truth    
even though there is still action going on  
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero  
some of the characters are not proper for their roles  
the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up  
if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done  
the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie  
the special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not  
another thing is the destruction scenes    
wow , those were masterpieces   
well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie  
this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office   
unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do   
i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments   
go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me  
one little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly     
and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance     
you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made "

-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously  
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  
no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  
the film is bleak and ugly looking  
taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth  
everything is ugly and dark  
new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish ""  
in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint  
for a scientist , this is very poor observation  
let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : 
1  ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? 
2  ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? 
i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating  
3  ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? 
4  ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables  
5  ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? 
if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures  
 ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide  
godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all )  
6  ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel  
7  ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot  
8  ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla  
9  ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel  
10  ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? 
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel  
11  ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ? 
12  ) why was dr "

-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art  
wrong  
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art  
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick  
same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies  
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled  
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens  
here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances  
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" )  
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line  
why are they here ? 
so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
wow ! "" 
gimme a break  
the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence  
otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you  
look , i'm 19 years old  
i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did  
i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse  
part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters  
it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent  
this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them  
it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! 
what they really need is a reality check  
the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting  
but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it  
the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it  
hence the title  
not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner  
everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex  
how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? 
how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? 
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? 
if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are  
and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world  
and if you still don't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting  
rose macgowan is horrible  
yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today  
her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable  
equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain  
his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do ! "" 
and then there's james duval  
let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando  
he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world  "" 
i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst  
or at least somewhere up there  
here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines : "" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent  
the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck  "" 
no explanation of this should be necessary  
and finally , a note to gregg : grow up  
really  
move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job  
and don't quit it "

 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult  
directed by bill duke 
ellsworth bumpy johnson        lawrence 
fishburne dutch schultz             tim 
roth lucky luciano           andy

-1,"what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie  
the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en ""  
director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered )  
however , gratuitous is joel's middle name  
he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  
no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness  
he doesn't leave much to the imagination  
it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) 
craft  
case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) 
drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? )  
see    no 
subtlety  
does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? 
who do we root for in this mess ? 
is there anybody out there ? 
it's not all the director's fault , though  
why did the actors sign up for this ? 
nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud ! 
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? 
what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? 
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? 
he was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action ""  
i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money    or 
they're suckers  
or they just don't care  
there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland  
catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs  wells  
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet  
the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter  
this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like "" payback "" ( which was a much better movie )  
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough  
during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off  
such a technical error indeed stands out  
speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers  
there's not much action here  
occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe "

-1,"when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ? 
i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones    
whoops , too late  ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise  
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy  "" 
it isn't funny the first time  
it isn't funny the eighth time  
it isn't funny the eighteenth time  
if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious  
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag  
he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside  
kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks  
wow  
what a magnificent bastard  
nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball  
when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before  
the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics  
shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings  
shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day    
they get married  
yup  
the next day  
cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! 
bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty    
if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species  
she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic  
there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant  
when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings "" high hopes "" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , "" now you can't leave me  "" 
we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of "" guilt , "" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing  
and eventually , shandling falls in love with her    
for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it  
what's the message i derive from all this ? 
men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough    
well , maybe something will click

it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe - there's a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
 ( yes , that is sarcasm )  
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad     but 
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses  
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape     bang 
bang  
though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences  
considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple  
the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer "

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium  
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind  
we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film  
meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined  
so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  
he did not  
by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
when they say that "" fans "" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth  
on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there  
how true that is when we see the "" explicit "" x-files - there is nothing there

-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris' wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
good question  
and i like good thought-provoking questions  
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects  
hey chris : did you forget ? 
your thoughts are _real_  
they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay  
so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
because there would be no movie , that+s why  
and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr  ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy  "" 
umm    
if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real  
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that  
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology  
all due respect  
another idea , based on "" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "" 
so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up  
you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out  
and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky  
there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot  
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale  
most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along  
and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion  
_gag me with a spoon_  
so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects  
please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings  
it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack  
my vote goes to a rare cd called "" never say die "" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group  
it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide  
 ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late    )  
melancholic , yes  
depressing , yes  
but far more entertaining    
so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight  
suicide--bad  
_don+t do it_  
no  no  no  ( got it ? --you 
shouldn+t have to pay $7  50 to hear this in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest "

i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

-1,"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell  
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it  
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film  
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr  lindo turns out the films best performance  
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d  b  woodside as issac's son , colin  
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in  
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written  
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film  
having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good  
but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes  
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in  
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing  
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever  
the best things about the film are its fight scenes  
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles  
one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat  
here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet's u  s  debut ) didn't allow  
unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision  
also "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent  
obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film  
it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted  
one problem though about the fight scenes  
those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon  
they do have an internal rhythm to them  
a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography  
the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance  
this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing  
here in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato  
every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern  
the rhythm is monotonous  
a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact  
'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever  
a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films   
watch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help )  
now look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx ""  
there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath  
the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted "
-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate 
directed by taylor hackford john milton                   al pacino kevin lomax                 keanu 
reeves mary ann lomax   "

 "" it's just    
the way    
we are  "" 
--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
lois lane's sister , lucy  
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! )  
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done  
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars )  
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers  
also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 
a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! )  
finally , just one word : monsters  
faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" 
at one point )  
dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though , it's still annoying  
now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! 
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself    
yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful )  
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u  s  theaters  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 "

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now he's just a spoiled kid  
in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend  
now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15  
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
this brings us to the villains  
arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday  
the most rediculous scene is during mr  freeze's imprisonment  
the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film  
it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member  
umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status  
her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in "" sextette "" ( 1978 )  
the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough  
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film  
without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first "" batman "" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel  
mr  freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video  
every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume  
with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation  
the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , 
gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series  
you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film  
the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film  
and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing  
every set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come  
there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film  
everything is set for maximum exposure  
the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have  
there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on "" the time machine "" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured  
joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair  
camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series  
master shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had  
mr  schumacher is a good director  
one just has to look back on the films "" the lost boys "" , "" cousins "" ( an underrated film ) and "" the client "" to know that  
but "" batman and robin "" comes off as a mated made for tv movie  
the film has no style of individuality  
it is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty  
it is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise "

but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race  
after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning  
jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional  
it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt  
now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface  
the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! 
by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work  
director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er  "" 
her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film  
well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one  
suggestion to ms  leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre  
much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off  
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours )  
it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring  
of course , leder isn't all to blame for it  
screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time  
what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway )  
chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) 
and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again  
only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring  
and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi  
to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation  
that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit  
scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic  
but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening  
the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable  
what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface  
give me a break , will ya ? 
and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth  
well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant  
the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous  
cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks  
in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days  
just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be  
one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors  
leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror  
this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) "

woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room  
the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it  
yeah , that's what i said  
stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc  the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully  
not even actually funny for a second  
my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on  
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games  
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon  
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much  
and david proval has never overacted as much  
and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window  
a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still    
the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek 
would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? 
nope  
luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her  
surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential  
it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny  
but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once  
antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny  
but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny  
but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time  
oh ! 
the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party  
antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong    it 
was okay  
the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) 
ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film  
he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row  
they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light  
they also pay him a lot of cash  
this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy  
tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor  
it took quentin to realize that  
but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that  
if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars  
but this sucked  
it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good  
he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes  
that makes no sense  
it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven  
it's long and it's just not very good  
hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one  
conclusion : what's the moral here ? 
if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece  
they should have re-watched "" new york stories "" and then stopped in their tracks "

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter ( connery )  
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him , or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines )  
along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense  
for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film  
the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established  
they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard )  
the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive  
like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  
and i guarantee you , it will wane  
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think  
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens  
there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut  
in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad )  
the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast  
they aren't  
the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film  
they aren't , either  
and what about this wasted cast ? 
oh , it makes me weep with disappointment  
we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever *  
i love the guy  
i've loved all his films , until this one  
he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are  
and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here  
 ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting  ) 
connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter  
who is to blame ? 
is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? 
perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right  
is it the actors ? 
for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  
i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with  
his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor  
add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory  
if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design  
the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at  
i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense  
i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr  peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere  
i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits  
but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here  
inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice  
maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story  
or a sense of purpose "

-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good  
but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job )  
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 
arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points  
she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better  
as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes  "" 
alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film  
she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in "" clueless , "" but her lines kinda sound weird  
and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time  
but in all fairness , she has virtually no part  
joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff    although 
i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
and poor elle  
poor , poor elle  
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw "" sirens "" )  
but she has no part ! ! ! 
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product  
there are no "" couch "" scenes ( like my best friend noticed )  
now listen to me on this one - in every "" batman "" flick , there's a couch scene  
in the original , it was with vicki  
in "" returns , "" it was a good make-out scene with selena  
and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole  
this one , it's nothing  
and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly "" part of the family  "" 
fortunately , we get a lot of alfred  
he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life "

-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow  
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh  
spooky  
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes  
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night  
wacky hijinks ensue  
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket  
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards  
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours  
 ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes  
okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves    oh , 
nevermind  ) 
this movie was awful  
simply awful  
the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development  
erica is the nature-loving wiccan  
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman  
steven is the overbearing asshole  
kim is the antisocial goth girl  
old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures  
how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? 
because she's pregnant ! 
how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? 
because she wears a lot of eye makeup ! 
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? 
because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" ! 
this is weak storytelling at its worst  
rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action  
it didn't work  
on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid  
 ( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie  
let's get on a plane home  "" 
 "" no  
i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on  "" 
 "" ok  "" ) 
frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch  
i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film  
the first movie worked by never showing us the horror  
the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact  
the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be  
this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie  
blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out  
this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort  
knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care  
this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything  
by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours  
it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail  
i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying  
i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster , "" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind "

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however  
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
the conclusion ? 
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  
david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  
many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests  
the extended version , however , is a rather different beast  
in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  
but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects  
in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  
stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  
he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth ""  
certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object  
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas  
most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline  
paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously  
the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained  
paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably  
and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe  
as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior  
as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept  
the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  
there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order  
and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg  
ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context  
this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so  
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s  television  
but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book  
the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug ""  
its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work  
despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film  
all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences  
unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the "" alan smithee "" version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been  
on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit  
still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen  
with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron 
kate                         jennifer aniston nick             "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes  
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet  
 ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect  ) 
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks  
and the language they talk is earth- english  
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english  
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships  
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic  
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter  
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power  
she is bent on making the world a better place  
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari  
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film  
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward  
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes  
this is a further abandonment of the source material  
the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book  
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down  
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them  
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn  
this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in  
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win  
the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character  
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals  
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog  
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup  
in general it seems much improved from 1968  
the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version  
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper  
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion  
chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker  
today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement  
these visuals work nicely  
what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make  
they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon  
apes spring incredible distances  
some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost  
one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up  
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up  
the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti  
it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes  
but he delivers them very well "
