1,"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal  
the setting of the film is a town named blue bay  
it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors  
the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school  
it is here that we meet all of the core characters  
there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan  
we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly  
throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape  
shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well  
this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted  
during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her  
however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor  
after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her  
it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together  
it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda  
matt dillon stars as sam lombardo  
sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage  
he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance  
however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place  
neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller  
suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film  
campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch  
playing kelly van ryan is denise richards  
kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra  
one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother  
denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film  
in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well  
kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette  
this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film  
however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story "
1,"i swear i have seen the edge before  
in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence  
even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s  
the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  
i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  
this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world )  
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely )  
the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film  
but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively )  
charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character  
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness  
they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  
charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob  
as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect  
soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality  "" 
charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  
down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  
director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  
he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  
take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot  
this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears "
1,"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to  
it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy  
yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story  
the wings of the dove fits the pattern  
kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love  
merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate  
but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class  
her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man  
naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich  "" 
kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable  
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice  
at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees  
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her  
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup  
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it  
he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute  
the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated  
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton  
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate  
kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple  
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact  
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies  
millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate  
she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees  
kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together  
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her  
he's not sure he can separate the two  
kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else  
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved  
without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly "

1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to "
1,"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies  
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col  nicholson and col  saito  
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person  
the audience is supposed to applaud col  nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not  
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col  nicholson takes for his men  
 ( the plot by-passes these risks  ) 
that means , the picture isn't perfect "

1,"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur  "" 
instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them  
chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal  
bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood  
bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure  
the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house  
since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films  
we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness  
but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film  
rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom  
lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh  
the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot  
even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment  
he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion  
when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense  
it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire  
bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds  
 "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music  
he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits  
the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest  
like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices  
all the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again  
never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word  
instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images  
in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't  
the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment  
however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable  
for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs  
he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag  
while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome "

1,"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex  
it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year )  
in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman  
they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other  
he is an m  d  , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party  
at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else  
when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night  
he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with  
they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer  
she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night  
bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient  
this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town  
the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down  
he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street  
then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other  
erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider  
much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros  digitally edited the orgy scene  
with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating  
european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it  
roger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations  
i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere  
the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks  
this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery  
from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at  
to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still  
at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity  
it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic "

1,"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years  
it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood  
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex  
yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster  
for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage  
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking  
and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer  
`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year  
just how great are their hormones raging ? 
one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot  
the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim  
kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right  
but what is the perfect time ? 
there is just no way to know , and that frightens him  
oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive  
he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages  
finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl  
so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess  
suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him  
but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful  
when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through  
he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge  
this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny  
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating  
there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald  
in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating  
but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison  
teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest  
but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here  
these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex  
their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences  
they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility "

by the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk  
this could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis  
and then there's the next morning  
there's a lot to like about this movie  
there are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues  
grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career  
in the world of "" what have you done for me lately ? "" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first  
instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood  
he doesn't have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire )  
james may be suicidal and psychotic  
certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie

1,"urban legend surprised me  
based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena  
thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  
you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks    the 
only person you didn't suspect ! 
however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment  
it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year  
the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive  
maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt )  
or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks  
more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise  
i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman  
urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film  
a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill  
one problem , though  
would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? 
i thought not  
predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company  
it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line  
naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off  
and the when we least expect it    whack ! ! ! 
a decapitation  
it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car  
so who is it this time ? 
the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends  
a-ha  
or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? 
like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit  
and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect  
i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince  
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her  
this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  
while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  
do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? 
is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? 
 ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan  ) 
fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast  
chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film  
 ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber  ) 
similarly , samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab  
he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend  
pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton  
in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast  
of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashman's untimely death  
not only are mr  menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr  ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film

1,"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses  
see contact with your family  
it is a movie for all ages  
--a review by stuart cracraft 
contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 
after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof  morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side  
by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there  
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies  
however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s  r  
hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive  
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal )  
this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice  
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation  
foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms  
early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this  
the movie's pacing is very good and subtle  
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful  
the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however  
one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation  
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored  
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters  
everything else was very one-sided ( e  g  
foster )  
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table  
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega  
it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory  
in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens  
the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction  
but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster "
1,"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter  "" 
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr  woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole  
 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 
mr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker  
that's right  
i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time  
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater  
you silly goose  
well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life  
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof  
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  
he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug  
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win  
in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play  
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand  
months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  
when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash  
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life  
to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth  
rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former  
the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all  
there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots  
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it  
we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them  
matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker "
1,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry  
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script  
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order  
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws  
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes  
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws  
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl  
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard  
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs  
this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced  
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone  
the film only gets better from this point  
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats  
they walk in unison and they only look forward  
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens  
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films  
one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world  
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless  
 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film  
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army  
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others  
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film  
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be  
however , as the film develops so does ness  
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side  
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends  
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in  
sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables  
malone acts as a mentor to ness "

1,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question  
still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated  
by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious  
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal  
he is insane , apparently  
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  
he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax  
but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively  
you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house  
but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  
bad cutting puts the timing way out "

1,"we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist  
years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world  
the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown  
based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father  
in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy  
the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys  
david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia  
the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house  
he is well lit via the external house lights  
his teacher isn't home  
we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open  
there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano  
david's fall over the dark cliff has begun  
instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction ""  
this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets  
the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion  
adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion  
the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out  
whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work  
his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny  
taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role  
we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building  
his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart  
technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production  
i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects  
one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain  
the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice  
with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat  
the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd  
but it's us being clapped "

1,"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  
this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn  
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  
 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him  ) 
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm  
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  
this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l  jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  
however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  
jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  
of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell  
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  
sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  
instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal  
since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars  
with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 
by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  
however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  
jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  
instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies  
at least this film has a little imagination  
most of the performances in jackie brown are above par  
pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable

1,"what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker  
the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! 
i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" 
and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play  
nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman  
nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series )  
on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny  
his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film  
but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind  
the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister  
this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! 
but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman  
like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader  
but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! 
keaton delivers  
he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman  
even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city  
visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team  
the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke  "" 
burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen  
the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations  
nicholson isn't joking when he boasts , "" wait 'till they get a load of me ! "" 
his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous  
keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate  
batman's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop  
production designer anton furst's sets are a wonder  
gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york  
the batcave is cold , bare , and desolate  
the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption  
the movie's gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold  
the plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing  
the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting  
it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear  
batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one  
as i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings "

1,"do film critics have morals ? 
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc  the difference ? 
well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much )  
on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
can't be that good )  
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense ? 
ok , but what about comparing ? 
isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
i think it is , and i'll tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 
it was sooooo cheezy ! "" 
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important ? 
and which is better ? 
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 
getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" 
and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier  
 ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l  jackson and comparison #2 )  
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  
ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  
it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? 
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself  
coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry  
max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  
also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself

1,"the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is  
think about it    
these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public  
they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those  
and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet  
when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie ""  
look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide    
all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment  
gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u  s  naval submarine during world war ii  
we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton )  
mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence  
the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters  
the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence  
the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion  
it's tense , exciting and fascinating  
and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles  
most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away  
once the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder "" ok , now how do they get out of this ? ""  
the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there  
i only have two minor complaints about the entire film  
the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence  
while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally  
i mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ? 
because of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom ! 
my other gripe would be during the film's finale  
there's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one "

1,"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment ""  
i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition  
i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit  
fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc  culture  cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs  
i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so  
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement  
as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident  
the proper questions to put relate to castro's legitimacy  
i bet the film takes castro's power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba's state control , cannot question his right to run cuba's political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years )  
that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime  
let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up  
i saw the film--twice  
i was right ; castro remained intact  
strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young "" dialectic materialist , "" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba  
the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution's reason for being  
grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty  
therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians  
cuba's government is castro  
diego's lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life  
he enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art  
he does not do "" voluntary work "" for the revolution  
his small apartment is a sensual oasis  
the moniker "" bourgeois "" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie  
however , he is a "" revolucionario "" in his own way  
the supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david's roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david's ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government  
gutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too  
heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor  
he really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws "
1,"mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er  
her mast famous episode , "" love's labour lost "" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child  
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing  
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies  
so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster  
and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint  
peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new  
the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen  
despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent  
it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better  
once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off  
george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world  
he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters  
nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling  
there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly  
the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them  clooney 
goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt  
this is when leder starts to show her true stuff  
she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer  
then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter  
then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them  
mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense  
she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking  
nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero  
you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her  
george clooney is a real movie star  
many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real  
he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality  
he'll be around for a while  
dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker "

synopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth ship' to fire a captured british missile at the city of beijing  
super-agent james bond ( pierce brosnan ) uses trick gadgets , pluck , and charm in order to foil carver's scheme  
this time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh )  
the film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments  
opinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie  
it neither stands out nor disappoints  
in old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia agent felix leiter  
tomorrow never dies introduces a new character in the form of chinese agent wai lin  
like leiter's character , wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie  
stars : michelle yeoh was born a leo in the western zodiac in the year of the tiger on the asian astrology calendar  
i dont believe in horoscopes  
but at an airport i once browsed an astrology book with a section on leo tigers ( lts )  
 "" leo tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace  
lts are unbelievably courageous when facing adversity  
the lt is also classy , and has an excellent sense of refinement , but she sees herself as an adventurer , and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status symbols  
this person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty  
she delights in siblings , nephews , nieces and extended family - - but she must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases  
sometimes annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes  
in love life , the lt has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any partner who is less powerful than she  "" 
in real life , michelle yeoh is asia's top female star  
like jackie chan , she does her own stunts  
she was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english  
she was taught malay in school , and learned cantonese from bilingual parents  
as an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally  
she enjoyed squash , diving , swimming , and rugby  
she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london , but switched to drama after a spinal injury  
in 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to , since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge  
notoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine  
michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies  
her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year "
1,"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list  
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle  
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws  
together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy  
but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  
although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2  
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary  
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot  
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19  
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience  
because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  
in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project  
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  
the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  
but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  
the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open "
1,"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself  
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself  
the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself  
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role  
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling  
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple  
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex  
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder  
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously  
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l  a  - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked  
van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored  
at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality    "" 
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration  
of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary  
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made  
at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it  
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass "

the people vs  larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler  
based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life  
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance  
he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus  
by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt  
this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court  
however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means  
larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love  
larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love )  
both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs  
flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin  
althea had joined him in taking the drugs  
following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them  
as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick  
courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect  
it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away  
edward norton plays flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman  
again , this is a solid performance  
the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics  
flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it  
isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court  
milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs  larry flynt  
it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story  
due to larry's character it is also , at times , a very funny film  
however , it is much more than that  
it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy  
an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) "

know the type , he uses his charm and his wits rather than a gun  
but even charming guys end up unlucky , and jack ends up in jail  
but not for long  
he plots an escape with the help of his best friend , and fellow robber , buddy bragg ( ving rhames ) , and their slow-witted pothead associate , glenn michaels ( steve zahn )  
but jack didn't count on u  s  marshal karen sisco ( jennifer lopez )  
appearing at the right place at the wrong time , karen gets involved in foley's escape attempt and the subsequent manhunt to bring him in  
however , karen develops a rapport with jack foley , and finds that she begrudgingly likes the guy  
but , can love prosper on opposite sides of the law ? 
or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime  
clooney , who has had a string of solid , but never stellar , film roles , delivers his best performance to date  
he blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley , who's willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love  
jennifer lopez does an excellent job as well  
she actually has a trickier role than clooney , as a woman who has to balance her emotions with her sense of duty  
she and clooney develop good chemistry together  
the film boasts a superb ensemble  
steve zahn gives a hilarious performance , and steals nearly every scene he's in  
don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex-con who may or may not be teaming up with foley  
albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good  
out of the cast , only dennis farina seems underused as karen's ex-lawman father  
steven soderbergh gives the film sharp and stylistic direction  
with an affectation for freeze frames , he delivers a unique take on the film's action and love scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films  
a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is  
devoid of its bells and whistles , out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story  
however , there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare , and they pass quickly "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour  
 ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way  ) 
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out )  
the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis  
it's also vastly more convincing with its argument  
 "" mathematics is the language of the universe , "" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture  
since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning  
obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system  
sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness  
the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood  
it helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist  
all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries  
for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr  gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest  
still , we do care about max's fate  
teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions  
as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary  
pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality  
the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective  
in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr  aronofsky's striking direction  
it's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings  
 ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr  gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu  ) 
using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts  
pi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead )  
the film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity  
still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour "

1," "" the deep end "" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues  
alluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding  
after taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land  
the production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters  
but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "" the deep end "" gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating  
spoiler alert : the following reveals the basic storyline  
i believe the plot points are incidental , because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters , but still , you should proceed at your own risk  
with her husband tom , a naval officer , often away at sea , margaret hall ( tilda swinton ) holds down the fort , taking care of the children , beau ( jonathan tucker ) , paige ( tamara hope ) , and dylan ( jordon dorrance ) , while her father-in-law jack ( peter donat ) hovers in the background , always watching  
the story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno  
it seems that beau , her eldest , is having an affair with darby reese ( josh lucas ) , a disreputable sort 12 years his senior  
margaret demands that darby leave her son alone , only to have the man smirk at her and announce he'll be glad to steer clear of beau ? for $5000  
back at home , she tries to talk about it all with her son , but the kid won't even confirm that he's gay , let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend  
he does , however , get attentive when she reveals darby's $5 , 000 offer , even as he maintains his sullen demeanor  
late in the evening , darby shows up outside , tossing pebbles at beau's window like a schoolchild  
the two meet by the water at the boathouse , where something important happens  
i won't reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not  
all of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie , by the way  
within a day or so , margaret's life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic ) turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby  
he and his associate are willing to destroy the tape , once margaret coughs up $50 , 000  
oh , what's a mother to do ? 
end spoilers 
written , directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) , "" the deep end "" is based on elisabeth sanxay holding's 1940's novel , "" the blank wall , "" which was also the source of the 1949 film , "" the reckless moment  "" 
i've neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details  
in holding's story , the "" scandalous "" relationship is between an older man and margaret's teen-age daughter  
switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary , and it also raises questions about margaret's motives  
many reviews of "" the deep end "" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder  
consider this : margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home  
her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure  
her father-in-law is constantly present , almost as if he is monitoring for his son  
and when her husband does call , margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family  
so is margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him ? 
or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency , desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea ? 
you sort it out  
regardless , the resonance of "" the deep end "" comes from two actors "

1,"plot : a big-time momma's boy can't seem to leave his mother's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world  
he visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is    well , he doesn't have any goals  
then one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn't as welcome anymore in his own house  
it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well    it's 
either time to grow up or bow down ! 
critique : first things first ! 
this movie ain't about the "" hood "" at all , it's an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up  
do not avoid this film because you think it's about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn't at all  
it's about you , it's about me , it's about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well    grow 
up ! 
this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match  
granted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did  
this isn't a kid's movie  
this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full "" adulthood "" and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step  
i certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i'm not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case )  
but that's not even half the story  
you see , the film is damn funny , too    and 
i mean , damn funny ! 
i was crackin' up at almost every other scene , and they weren't "" set-up jokes "" like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is "" drinking koolaid "" in the kitchen and his infamously improvised "" african squat f * * k "" scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) 
and there are the performances , too  
ving rhames , now here's a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year  
damn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! 
tyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say    hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee  
from scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day "

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air  
it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't  
it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't  
and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending  
even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless  
hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic )  
yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  
weird  
this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list  "" 
in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  
after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  
 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  
and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film  
it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying  
if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way  
but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine  
but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it  
it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins  
it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full  
we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it  
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness  
in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  
in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it  
in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  
point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success )  
point two , it has been through several lawyers  
after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out   "
1,"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film  
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking  
yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness  
the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft  
while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass  
this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is  
much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers  
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff  
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city  
however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l  jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors  
when a privileged young man named walter wade jr  ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p  i  
but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime  
peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film  
peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages  
however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming )  
it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless  
then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars  
bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on  
collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane  
busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan  
registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno  
 ( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene  ) 
that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director  
this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases  
they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them  
these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional  
but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive "

1,"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year  
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office  
this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy  
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them  
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza  
in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell  
he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra  
evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable  
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there  
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors )  
now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead  "" 
the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book  
along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra  
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt  
don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time  
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers  
on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide  
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though  
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world  
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin  
these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy  
as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country  
in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles  
when playing "" george "" in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone  
i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens  
in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle  
although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast  
weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film  
the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time  
evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention "

1,"vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks  
it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about  
based on anne rice's novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell  
the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco  
the camera slowly find particular window  
a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness  
 "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? ""  
the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater )  
his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise )  
given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret  
everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace  
louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough  
eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis  
for a while , they are one "" big , happy family  "" 
but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation  
when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned  
director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere  
as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun  
when luis is "" born to darkness "" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight  
the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film  
from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days  
the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain  
the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective  
cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty  
cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance  
with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear

it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life  
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  
therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner  
it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself  
the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war  
this plays a major factor in the film's success  
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy  
it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers  
can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? 
the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them  
it doesn't simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  
building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? 
we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  
she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  
right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  
being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i  e  
who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i  e  
getting married just to spite someone )  
the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  
he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  
her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see  
she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband  
her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense  
acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable )  
he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation  
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  
he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition "
1,"everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with "" progress  "" 
giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis  
his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth  
this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being  
despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love  
and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places  
giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e  m  forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go  
what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii  
a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress  
just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight  
giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes  
 ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr  ) 
eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located  
bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi )  
eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice  
but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant  
love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that  
in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect  
it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it  
in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target  
in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited  
from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame  
it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions  
jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie  
he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie  
meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin  
love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world )  
yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots "

however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform  
inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider  
he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions  
he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice

instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave

hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went  
the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes  
the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles  
neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past  
the supporting cast is also extraordinary  
the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius  
the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film  
the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length  
while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation  
it , too , is an epic   "
1,"i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski  
the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect  
the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians  
he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes  
after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug  
the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l  a  so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug  
the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped  
he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers  
dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers  
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny  
it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films  
not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure  
all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived  
each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension  
the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh  
it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie  
worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator  
aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue  
people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends    
they sound natural  
taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers  
ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing  
he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film  
perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty  
but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film  
all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy "

1,"note : ordinarily , moviereviews  org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as "" spoilers  "" 
however , being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews  org 
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations , plot giveaways will appear in the following review  
if this bothers you , please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now  
 "" what does it take to play carnegie hall ? 
practice  "" 
it takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall , "" both figuratively and literally  
like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean  
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school  
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors  
that is the pattern-like plot of this production  
ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish  
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful  
roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat  
also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around  
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre  
they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said    "" ) and a glowing concert  
not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point  
but they don't  
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent  
director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing  
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but    
last night  "
1,"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  
while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view  
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil )  
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker  
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  
even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  
in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  
like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  
when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  
however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  
stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present  
as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  
these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently  
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  
however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  
however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  
consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  
in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier  
however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing  
during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  
stephane attempts to remain unchanged  
however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation  
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  
the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible  
american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  
in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane  
the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters "
1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible "
1,"known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone  
the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable  
the other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here  
edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel  
stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions  
agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor  
this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night  
just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear  
the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers  
since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss  
allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella  "" 
the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been  
you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha  
the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner  
and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers  
you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's  
additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts  
playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa  
julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989's "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence  
it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j  f  lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing  
after "" pretty woman , "" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released "" runaway bride , "" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder  
roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star  
an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances  
no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path  
on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty  
another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days  
 "" pretty woman "" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances  
this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem "
1,"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really  
it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target )  
in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians  
these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed )  
this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by    well , 
you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is )  
moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do )  
in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do )  
this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think  
after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do )  
movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle  
maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway )  
the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense )  
in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story  
unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he    well , 
you'll see  
the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots  
one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka  
another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw  
and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint  
of course , the movie does have its share of silliness  
for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head  
in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become  
but what has he become ? 
a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? 
doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre  
but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly  
so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films "
1,
1,"one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length  
if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap  
but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent  
boogie nights falls into the latter catagory  
the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along  
mark whalberg , a  k  a 
marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area  
jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business  
after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies  
in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h  macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script  
we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband  
but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing  
the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up  
there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches  
the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 )  ) 
boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) 
the soundtrack is also excellent  
like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift  
also , the costumes are great  
the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties  
the film , although excellent , does have some flaws  
firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry  
in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost  
but the rest of the cast are excellent  
burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h  macy is great aswell ( but he always is  ) 
another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on  
it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly  
it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced "
1,"the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , "" snatch  "" 
 "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end  
his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive  
with "" snatch , "" the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process  
>from the very beginning , "" snatch "" tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina )  
en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug "" the head "" ( mike reid )  
frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris "" the blade "" ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster  
the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry  
meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm  
when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight  
mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal  
brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse  
when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , "" bullet tooth "" tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond  
things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy  
guy ritchie ( mr  madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire  
the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example  
the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives "" snatch "" an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld  
the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting  
alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top  
when he refuses sugar in his tea because "" i'm sweet enough , "" it makes you shiver , even as you laugh  
his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years  
the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially  
pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe  
this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack )  
when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped  
pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer  
the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life  
there is a patent feel to the look of "" snatch "" and "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" that reeks of "" signature "" for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works  
there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions "
1,"originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i  e  
 "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman  
plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love ? 
why do people fall out of love ? 
how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip , young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples' issues  
others with the married  
there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very , very good  
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations  
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever  
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart  
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn  
the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood  
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5  5/10 ) and happiness ( 4  5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness "
1,"jerry springer has got nothing on "" wild things  "" 
john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline  
but even trash tv topicality can't drag "" wild things "" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast  
despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here  
 "" wild things "" would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it  
high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent  
hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped  
before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court  
the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph  
while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her  
to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8  5 million  
but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can  
duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations  
if there's a major drawback to "" wild things , "" it's that it's oversexed to a fault  
the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off  
it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often  
what we don't see is far more effective than what we do  
another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene  
er , no thanks  
also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten  
daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's "" rent , "" tries to compensate for a superfluous character  
theresa russell is just plain wooden  
and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary  
but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end  
 "" wild things "" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship  
a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off  
and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell  
speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in "" starship troopers "
1,"'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed 
 ( www  pleasantville  com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) 
cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h  macy , joan allen , j  t  
walsh , jeff daniels 
mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements 
genre : drama 
in my opinion : 
in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is  
review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions  
the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant  
there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate  
put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for  
j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an "" oldies "" tv station ? or is it ? 
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed  
i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office  
but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy "" dollar theaters "" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced  
it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all  
instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right  
there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story  
now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be  
besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch  
the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable  
after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more  
a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork  
that said , the plot goes as such  
david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical "" relationship "" outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours  
they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today  
david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation  
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home  
nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed  
and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them  
not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place  
people got hurt "
1,"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy  "" 
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my money's worth  
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height  
the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not  
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended  
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide  
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h  macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs  
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn "

1,"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film  
the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars  
to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film  
as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin  
the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous  
this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds  
it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film  
 "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america  
jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental  
in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers  
he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present  
preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters  
the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted  
tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him  
as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist  
poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character  
never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing  
however , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance  
as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role  
he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople  
he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him  
as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff  
he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors  
what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film  
he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil  
instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future  
most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes  
this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day  
jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate  
 "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's "

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them  
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci )  
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  
vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain  
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  
hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother  
 ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" ) 
in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall  
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  
two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  
by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  
raging bull is the other side of rocky  
sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976  
it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production "

1,"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards  
the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u  s  distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints  
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe  
both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue  
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed  
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one  
everyone knows the story of dracula  
or do they ? 
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt  
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown  
upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her  
locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him  
upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises  
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art  
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised  
the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising  
there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points  
holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula  
past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp  
but kinski    oh boy , this is something far more compelling  
aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease  
this man is dreadfully lonely  
he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust "
1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug "

1," "" when it's cold , molecules aren't moving  
everything is clean  "" 
these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm  
when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him  
his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline )  
ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything  
meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations  
tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character  
we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul  
he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return  
the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie  
everything parallels everything else  
the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods  
 "" when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving  
everything is clean  "" 
everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on  
even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings  
how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? 
all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film  
at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ? 
you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either  
we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another  
at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven't gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain  
the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood  
he doesn't seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being  
christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy  
still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline  
tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost  
he was needed , but perhaps he should've been used more  
the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year  
i hate to say that i don't agree , but i don't  
in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one "

1,"it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that  
and so it is  
_the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i've seen since i-don't-know-when  
don't credit carrey  
it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago  
the story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience  
 ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that "" reality-based "" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture  
who knew ? ) 
one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place  
weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling  
it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame  
for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_  
the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island  
credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey  
carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near  
not here  
his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on  
and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably  
playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life  
no pun intended  
better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian  
it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being  
yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide  
he thinks  
rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs  
dalloway ) as carrey's true "" forbidden love "" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role  
laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development  
the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general  
there are other little problems with the script  
are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? 
was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? 
how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? 
and couldn't christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? 
these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work  
the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman's mundane existence for no other reason than it is there "

1,"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first )  
either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny  
why is this ? 
maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional  
director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day  
when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again  
i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends  
i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time  
and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around  
rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all  
he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman  
and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort  
he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it  
whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co  
grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives  
rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in  
during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him  
but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life )  
the plot in three words is : women and music  
the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective  
it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle  
it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is  
jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball  
just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week  
what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes  
john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob  
now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say  
the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended  
instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that  
also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie  
high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs "
1,"star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review 
a review by jamey hughton stars ) 
starring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g 
with all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film  
the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together  
can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away     ? 
yes  this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity  
but that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment  
the phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history  
the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film  
the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding  
the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects  
after we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan'  
they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo  
oh , but enough about that  
the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture  
as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader  
a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter  
this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see  
one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception  
i loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo )  
one character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race  
jar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief  
yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics  
there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses  
the final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold  
jabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances  
lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness  
one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii "

1,"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies  
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  
heh ! 
them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em  
of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters  
that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing  
confused ? 
let me explain : 
despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie  
luckily , it's a very good b movie  
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter  
therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  
of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  
we just don't know when or how horrible it will be  
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times  
a funny b movie ? 
well , that's new  
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh  
 ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while  ) 
and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen  
hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies  
cool  
familiar faces  
so far so good  
our man treat is the hero , he'll live  
wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim  
we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out  
famke is the babe , 'nuff said  
there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy "
1,"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! "" 
 ( actually , it's "" lock and load "" ) , you can't help thinking tarantino  
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers  
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon  
 "" inspired by true events "" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated    
or so strangely poignant  
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged  
beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker  
they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris  
when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up  
then , chris begins to rob banks    
luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer  
moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband  
 ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory )  
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person  
if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia  
as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece  
judd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris  
when pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint  
of course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life  
mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity  
it is the rational chris that loves guns ( "" shooting is about precision , control "" ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- "" chaos and you and me    
we're a real family "" , she notes wryly )  
it is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness )  
in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : "" buy-more "" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations "

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter "

1,"back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "" antz ""  
the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office  
again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film "" the prince of egypt "" and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well  
on a winning streak , they released "" the road to el dorado "" and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic "" chicken run "" in the summer  
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films  
shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself  
surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone  
the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested  
of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy )  
a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek  
lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house  
to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king  
shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona  
 "" shrek "" is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this  
the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic  
i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be  
i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year  
the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers  
in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer  
now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent    but he is shrek  
with his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart  
eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "" mulan "" does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film  
the tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in "" aladdin ""  
the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well  
she is very funny , and her character fits her to a t  of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors  
he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time "
1,"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings  
a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school  
less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp  here the setting was the corporate world of new york  
now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies  
like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player  
julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution  
josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion  
o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy  
the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? 
- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim  
an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits  
and that is how it should be  
of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery  
kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts  
the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin  
plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood  
the script follows the familiar lines of the classic  
hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game  
it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved  
the performances in o vary  
phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease  
he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system  
hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover  
stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight  
the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging  
also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling  
why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back  
it is irrational  
but these are minor carpings  
overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation "
1,"every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he's not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre  
not to mention an expensive one  ) 
sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago  
with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it's equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 )  
directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 )  
while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale  
and boy , did he take that route ! 
i'd say at about 165 mph or so    
the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt  ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel  
if you'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship  
unfortunately , she thought she'd only be out for a couple of weeks    
once she's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy  
in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor ""  
it seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost    
it doesn't exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" big mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony  
when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins  
only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system  
and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens    
what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes  
cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you're literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around  
which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death  
many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches "
1,"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career  
based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system  
beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown  
after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt  ) 
instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him  
however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin  
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry  ) 
it's remarkable that this film was released at all  
much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name  
the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true  
it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject  
talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun  
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed  
even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor  
 ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see  ) 
the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well  ) 
and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed  
it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself  
second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps  
halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator  
also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun  
and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself  
the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par  
the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well  
the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever  
they're not cringe inducing , at least  
the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system  
best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining  
there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes  
bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws "

1,"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart  
however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock  
nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest  
the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole  
the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama  
the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages  
the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end  
instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans  
they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin  
we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled  
there is comedy and tragedy  
most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth  
the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year  
it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over  
the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance  
it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured  
there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship  
the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson )  
these two have a stormy relationship  
they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other  
much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other  
frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father  
on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks  
although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction  
once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned  
lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees  
death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area  
it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased  
it's the ceremony that they're interested in  
sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water "

just close your eyes and think of england  
during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them  
adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc  ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history  
resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes  
grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along  
a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus )  
the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence  
during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake  
rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob  
in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death  
when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears  
grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob  
through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape  
grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger )  
she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence  
maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance  
the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values  
aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones  
the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction )  
the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification  
lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke  
that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic  
rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future "

1,"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 
cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an anti-movie , of sorts  
there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai  
life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books  
ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead  
living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends  
he craves nothing more  
as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see  "" 
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings  
ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented  
in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family  
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment  
after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey ) "
1,"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year  
from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998  
it is that good of a film  
when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous  
how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? 
but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about  
once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer  
and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special  
now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding )  
the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for )  
forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses  
in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade  
but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart  
you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers  
they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around )  
they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses  
it's funny , though  
if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable  
but believe me , it is anything but  
ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz )  
after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w  
early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from "" scream "" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom  
in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again  
jump to the present  
after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school  
healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself  
admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired  
after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? 
somehow , the farrelly's pull it off  
the performances here are also right on target  
as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable  
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w "
1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel  
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife  
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises  
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion  
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments  
is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them  
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  
if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue  
and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie  
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded  
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral  
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly  
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind  
worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival  
now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death  
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
will patrasche save the day ? 
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  
even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too  
there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  
move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  
the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film "

1,"perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits  
i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime  
my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book )  
in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century  
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations )  
however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film  
needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based  
i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision  
i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh  
it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered  
out of sight proves that it doesn't  
i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair  
after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars  
here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living  
he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start  
he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames )  
we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u  s  marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes  
fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety  
the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible  
we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise )  
at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too  
it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally  
i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does  
he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable  
he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film  
as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez  
lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too  
i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) "

1,"tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way

when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary  "" 
what's eating gilbert grape ? 
is such a film  
it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence  
gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities  
as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store  
he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates )  
gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down  
as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing  
slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people  
director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel  
endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else  
the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real  
minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife  
one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band  
not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false  
the same can be said of the character of gilbert  
it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once  "" 
gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty  
in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction  
his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , "" we're not going anywhere , "" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard  
johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands  
depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie  
he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real  
dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw  
darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters  
only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark  
gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me  
thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait "

1,"scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film  
it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery  
the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time  
scream was also known for its self-referential tone  
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven  
again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels  "" 
scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's  
sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college  
gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream )  
at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins  
the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer  
they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders  
the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference  
the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers  
the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press  
the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene  
 ( whew  ) 
the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch  
even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2  that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie  
the just add to the fun of watching it  
i recommend it for other reasons as well  
what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural  
no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible  
it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims  
no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer  
the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say "" it's just a movie  "" 
the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer  
they are likeable , but not outstanding  
but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint "

mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg ) 
though made in canada , "" overdrawn at the memory bank "" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production  
using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked  
raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority  
caught watching "" casablanca "" on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to "" doppling "" rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon  
 ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess  ) 
as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it  
as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on    while 
fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside  
during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings  
over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance  
given that "" casablanca "" is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to "" casablanca ""  
in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called "" the place ""  
julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the "" schweethaat "" -spouting parody seen in cartoons  
negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing  
the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system  
those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances  
the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around    as "" the fat man "" , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c  moore )  
while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system    with 
less than salutory results  
it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition  
words like "" dopple "" , "" psychist "" , "" computech "" , "" cinema "" , and "" reconst "" are apparently in common use "
1,"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton  
this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust  
but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice  
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore  
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence  
he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government  
instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official  
in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter  
guido wins dora  
they marry  
fast forward about five years  
guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family  
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore  
but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities  
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp  
here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated  
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched  
for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list  
true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor  
unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust  
his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child  
for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game  
giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points  
the winner takes home a tank  
therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks  
he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him  
guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates  
guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive  
throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way  
ultimately , the allies rescue the camp "

1,"what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? 
you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! 
plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it  
adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues  
critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride  
if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period ! 
if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times  
if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure  
watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! 
harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor  
now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! 
little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture  
it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound  
actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p  i  ""  
in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on  
hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas  
however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well  
looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not  
an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra  
during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong  
also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence  
both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom  
this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo  
the same type of opening is present in its sequels  
jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo ""  
this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9  5/10 )  
also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po  
they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark  
the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip  
as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened  
spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy  
the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed "
1,"plot : odin is a great high school basketball player  
he's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass  
in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him  
unfortunately , the coach's real son , hugo , isn't too pleased to hear that  
in fact , he doesn't like hearing about any of odin's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own  
so what does he set out to do ? 
well , let's just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to    well , 
you'll see  
critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted "" non-teen "" movie starring a bunch of teens  
credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core  
you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs  
hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me )  
phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character  
i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along  
julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently  
i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years  
his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all  
a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest  
i did have a few reservations about the movie though  
first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ? 
it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times  
the film was also edited pretty choppily    like 
some scenes were cut out and no one "" cleaned it up "" afterwards  
i also didn't like the fact that hartnett's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible  
in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups  
i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more "" realism "" under some of the circumstances  
but overall , the movie will devastate you  
it's not a "" fun date movie "" "

1,"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation  
on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  
on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events  
this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  
indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  
_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war  
for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil  
oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end  
what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished  
_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin  
the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse  
invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards  
sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves  
demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects  
all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real  
when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror  
instead , he asks who the ghost is  
as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created  
sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears  
in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay  
the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump  
sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health  
they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter  
only paul d is suspicious of the stranger  
little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years  
winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset  
she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show  
lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later  
danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter  
as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears "
1,"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina  
the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away  
the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads  
at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act  
that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave  
deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 )  
the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered  
over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over  
other plot elements are thrown in for good measure  
wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent  
braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate  
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful  
the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners  
deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense  
the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting  
deceiver has the power to grab an audience  
unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing  
for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers  
it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications  
of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic  
police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner  
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details  
deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute  
the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours  
the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened  
moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks  
the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere  
there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models "

1,"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact  
four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film  
the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy  
contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space  
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms )  
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive  
ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young  
in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth ""  
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together  
it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on  
meanwhile , dr  david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding  
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember  
it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science  
when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at  
eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated )  
the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? )  
as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer  
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs  religion  
the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias  
arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking  
when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests  
the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? 
even when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive  
don't get me wrong  
as much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film  
it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours  
despite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film  
the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) 
highly depreciated on the small screen  
even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci-fi "" "
1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth  
as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration  
during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo  ' 
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead  ' 
a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  
he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  
by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
but how realistic are these ideals ? 
joe had raped and been raped in texas  
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny  
we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame  
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york  
in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself  
standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh  
schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation  
beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison  
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation  
it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men  
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff  ' 
there are two predominant images of new york "
1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective  
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita  
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her  
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace  
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits  
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile  "
1,"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes  
many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit  
i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter  
it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be  
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! "" 
mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us  
as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty  "" 
in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman  
she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job  
positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking  
meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires  
two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition  
as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further  
i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot  
that's probably because it isn't one  
these are people  
this is their story  
director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting  
though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue  
supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners  
carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character  
we empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him  
emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance  
it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats  
also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster  
it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank  
not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes  
on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor  
while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage  
the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process  
things pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co "

1," ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information  ) 
seven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs  
it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled  
while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance  
for starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film  
while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up  
part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style  
he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse  
and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects )  
throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene  
these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing  
yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment  
in addition to style , fincher supplies substance  
seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society  
detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world  
its easy to see why  
the world doesn't make sense  
 ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct  
after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes  ) 
why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and "" picking up the pieces "" he will be able to catch the killer ? 
somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world )  
he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope  
however , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment  
these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered  
and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do  
but if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey )  
seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does  
one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a "" psycho , "" with no motives behind his slayings  
this is exactly the mistake mills makes  
in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society  
he's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down "
1,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form  
it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre  
what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
well     
1  you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother  
2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  
5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  
6  the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends  
7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  
8  eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so  
9  there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years  
10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so  
11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song  
since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill "

1,"you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it  
that's a bit more difficult  
the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies  
if you're not nice to it , you lose  
galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned  
 "" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over  "" 
that is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns  
it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble  
jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do  
the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt  
dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "" by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged "" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans  
one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "" galaxy quest "" followers  
they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia  
they have mistaken the "" galaxy quest "" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel  
the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris )  
nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes  
next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship  
of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them  
but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians  
i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked  
taking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody  
nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration  
the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a  k  a  tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek  
while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell "" i need more power down here captain ! "" , 
chen's cry for help is more to the tune of "" the core , like , won't take it or something  "" 
it's a hoot , but it doesn't stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren't far behind  
galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season  
by grabthar's hammer , this is a hell of a movie "
1,"in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural "" rush hour "" - to the tune of about $250 million  
you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in "" rush hour 2  "" 
the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world  
the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable  
i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations  
surprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it  
the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start  
terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime  
concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights  
instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars  
the makers of "" rush hour 2 "" are working at a distinct advantage over the original  
we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around  
that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit  
little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "" rush hour  "" 
first and foremost to me , in "" rh2 , "" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography  
the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint  
chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket  
his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino  
like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch  
chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys  
when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun  
when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff  
the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills  
the combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the "" lethal weapon "" films  
the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently  
john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance )  
lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to "" get lee and carter , "" but gives the chief bad guy elegance  
zhang zi-yi ( "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter  
 ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion  ) 
roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch "
1," "" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year  
it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords  
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint  
finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie  
stuart little is a mouse  
he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles  
a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city  
they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son  
at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat  
george doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond  
stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are  
the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back  
hesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending  
one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects  
just like in "" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace "" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real  
from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows  
another movie that this has in common with is "" babe "" with it's talking animals and people understanding them  
it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids  
michael j  fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the "" homeward bound "" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could  
he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable  
another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball  
when he was timon in 1994's "" the lion king "" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in "" stuart little "" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike  
for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well  
she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr  little  
both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's "" jerry maguire ""  
even though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other  
 "" stuart little "" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter  
we get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie "

1,"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there  
 "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here  
just don't forget to have fun  
clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman  
 "" i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose  
it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start  
this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface  "" 
spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in "" three kings "" ) takes it from there  
the white-hot director of the beastie boy's "" sabotage , "" an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  
jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style  
his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly  
and then there's the cast  
john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows  
over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved  
once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates  
financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building  
navigating around dr  lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted  
first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her  
and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich  
craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions )  
after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike  
then things get a little weird  
by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface  
one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up  
instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity  
he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself "
1,"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time  
with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way  
while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor  
in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say  
in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past  
he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career  
so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc  as a sort of payment  
the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end  
it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? 
the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner  
speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter  
every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing  
albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character  
the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone  
she wasn't likeable at all  
brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through  
in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak  
luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap  
it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy  
on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife  
she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in  
the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese  
i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary  
it was just plain hilarious  
it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas  
brilliant move by brooks  
as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before  
unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood  
 "" bowfinger "" had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but "" the muse "" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour  
by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low  
oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film  
it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s  
things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier )  
she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster )  
the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown  
meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars  
only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  
although jackie brown marks mr  tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  
while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black  
in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions  
the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era  
the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  
of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year  
tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? 
sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr  tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter  
these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  
this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal  
this new aspect of mr  tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  
mr  forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him  
much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr "
1,"plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes  
this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery  
critique : awesome ! 
i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp    so 
yes , i really dug this movie ! 
the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends    is 
very serious ! 
in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell  
it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much  
and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective "" kill scenes "" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances  
in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and "" feel "" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those "" unfortunates "" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers  
you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time  
but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered  
the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel "" from hell "" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? 
yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little "" love "" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already  
that's right , there's no real need to put any "" romance "" in a film about a mass murderer ! 
but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through  
sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one  
i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't )  
on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development  
but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement  
i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc    
in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters    or 
am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? 
perhaps  
overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting  
but it's not for everyone  
some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors "

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory  
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there  
in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen  
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme  
the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil  "" 
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage  
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief  
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened  
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet "
1,"plot : derek zoolander is a male model  
he is also very dumb and impressionable  
for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country  
will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? 
will zoolander ever grace the world his new "" look "" ? 
is this a funny movie ? 
find out below    
critique : there's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies ""  
films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes  
there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous  
well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time  
of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead  
i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry  
snap ! 
it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously  
and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others  
i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse  
hi-larious ! 
but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work  
a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? )  
i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! )  
but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! 
i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk-off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( "" i was a merman    a 
merman ! ! "" )  
and i dare you to get his "" monkey "" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( "" you're a monkey , derek    a 
monkey ! "" ) 
i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all  
again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well  
if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here  
blue steel , baby  "
1,"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned  
the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now  
eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
starring : tom cruise ( dr  
bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice  
16 months for this ? 
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them  
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be  
spoilers below : 
the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree  
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack  
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment  
soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed  
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time  
the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations  
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting  
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry  
in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects "

1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play  
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands  
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and 
the game is afoot     
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  
the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft  
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination   
not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel  
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively  
in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character  
as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows  
from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades  
every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript  
hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself  
julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players  
kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness  
richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing "
1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two  
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters  
the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children  
more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure ""  
the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate  
michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling  
constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children  
the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church  
later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million  "" 
but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness  
sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin  
but god does not take payoffs  
the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican  
there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal  
but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes   "" 
  
visually this film is as spectacular as the first two  
gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better  
but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection  
the third installment has only the plot and visuals  
some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films  
the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional  
the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars  
andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal  
violence is natural to him  
he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was "
1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity  
she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace  
anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces  
i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him ""  
at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car  
cu-sack  cu-sack - no , not quite as cool  
i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) ""  
he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius  
with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's  
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  
despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen  
and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller )  
high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit  
it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank  
it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me  
high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list ""  
this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off  
at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery  
he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us  
gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential )  
though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films  
the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy  
he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others  
but i like this guy , because of how black plays him "
1,"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture  
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act  
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious  
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr  ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing  
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman  
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game  
this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem  
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf  
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr  )  
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as    
mike tyson  
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time  
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence  
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls  
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing  
the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point  
the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film  
to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil  
these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way  
whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea  
charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i'll be way over this  "" 
these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it  
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny  
most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying  
he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit "

1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  
all the films released after it , have been less successful  
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor'  
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture  
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story  
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness  
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between  
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  
in a near future    on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real  
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered  
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  
the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive  
it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation  
in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person  
this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen  
they start to doubt in their own sanity  
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives  
it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy  
with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  
our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal  
the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile "
1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome ""  
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds  
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue ""  
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york "
1,"plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy  
but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working  
a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and    okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues  
critique : very cool ! 
now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight ! 
the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain "" cute "" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year  
tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film  
he is pure evil  
they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man  
what a great , great monster ! 
my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole "" kiss of the dragon "" thing to him and he cut him off by saying "" kiss my ass ! "" 
pure action movie poetry  
anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his "" acting "" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character  
actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot  
fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay  
but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances  
we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front  
and yes    they have no wire-fu in this movie    i 
say again    no 
wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute  
it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts  
if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film  
yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang  "

1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )  
but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it  
and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception  
thank god ! 
the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire    and 
co-star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one )  
the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating )  
there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull  
of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it  
oh well  
and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains  
this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in "" from russia with love "" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really )  
and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point  
the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench )  
and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in "" goldeneye , "" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying  
again , oh well  
the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long  
they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam "
1,"pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time  
in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it  
as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way  
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor  
to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l  jackson )  
these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect  
travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role  
if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the "" problem solver "" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel )  
these are just the major characters  
smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men "" behind "" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film  
the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other  
the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups  
the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead  
after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle  
utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants  
the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace  
after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase  
this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a  357 
 "" hand cannon "" , shooting at the two gangsters  
he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention  
this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue  
the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades  
butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune  
vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town  
vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage  
after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a "" monster "" by lance  
each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur  
eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules  
pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time "

1,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so )  
however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator  
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal )  
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  
zero takes the case , and the plot thickens  
his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens )  
despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark  
through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him  
i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film  
i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness )  
zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture  
with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them  
but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment  
take , for starters , the great cast of characters  
pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs  
zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe  
pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious  
ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny  
 "" i'll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point  
 "" i have a gun , and everything  "" 
his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job  
o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs  
i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film  
kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes )  
it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times  
there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective  
what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular  
i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero "
1,"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources  
each review compared this film to the truman show  
why ? 
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television  
other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other  
reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i  e  
the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies  
when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman  
the same goes for the thin red line , as well  
when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever  
critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards  
this is why i think pleasantville was underrated  
if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves  
sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history  
with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents  
his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes  
but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be  
the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote  
their new parents , played by william h  macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way  
their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville  
after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form  
it's just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don't want it to end  
 "" mary sue "" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color  
soon we learn that these people don't know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color  
this eventually sparks a racial war between the "" coloreds "" and the "" black & whites  "" 
entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , "" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show    "" 
yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent "

1,"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? 
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? 
i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth  
the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars  
based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed  
but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast  
they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action  
and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids  
little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v  evil going on in the depths of space  
one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious  
it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace  
a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key'  
in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? 
mandibles ? 
tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon  
therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners  
otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key'  
now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe  
the mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones  
he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore  
the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes  
he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , "" j "" , played by will smith  
but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie  
and , this isn't an independence day knockoff  
rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up  
but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario  
yet , this movie is very appealing  
the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc )  
it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder  
jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity "

1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 )  
the angels here are stark and believable  
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air  
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well  
they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven  
like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure  
 "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan )  
he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  
maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough  
he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance  
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human  
he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n  y  p  d  
blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance  
sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children  
of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it  
 "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire  "" 
wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  
the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  
and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage "
1,"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing  
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare  
while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid  
this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city  
 "" i don't think people listen to guys like me , "" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum  
just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision  
in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs  banks ( blythe danner ) , to "" just listen "" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage  
sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc  , his wife and two children won't be provided for  
he's not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he's somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped any by the fact that banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go  
overall , he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we'd deem "" far enough "" as the starting mark of some crazy race  
meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene  
covering a "" fluff "" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could've hoped for  
having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story  
max immediately bonds with sam  
max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone  
at first , max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him  
the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill  
the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam's honest ambitions  
also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max  
alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities  
then there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie  
she falls under max's wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting  
kirshner's credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow  
still , kirshner's character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles  
i wouldn't mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen  
while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability  
hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat  
they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both "

1,"plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum  
as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion  
saying anything else about the plot would be a crime  
have fun    
critique : "" i feel like shooting myself in the head "" are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here  
this ain't your average "" happy go lucky "" kind of picture  
this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards  
will it bore some people to sleep ? 
you bet it will ! 
is it made for the scream audiences of the day ? 
absolutely not ! 
i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the "" cerebral crowd ""  
a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later  
i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group  
in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a "" mindfuck ""  
if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you ! 
it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole "" peanut butter "" thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark  
 "" brrrrrrrrr    now 
what was that sound in the basement ? 
honey , can you go check ? "" 
and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects  
in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video    ah-ha ! )  
another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied , kids ! )  
and as clich ? d as it might be to say    it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such  
other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror  
the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get "" into "" it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released  
but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight "
1,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively  
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great  
underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way  
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point  
it goes from character to character  
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship  
it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real  
in short , this movie is just awesome  
it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers  
director anand tucker tells this story well  
he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real  
the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends  
they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two  
jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned  
when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn )  
they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone  
she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  
it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way  
the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized  
their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another  
when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success  
when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man )  
and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  
another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance  
i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three )  
my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job  
the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? 
hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts  
in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off  
she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about  
but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons "
1,"plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention  
the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road  
who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  
critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! 
it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around  
a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 
a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  
it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop  
this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments  
in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim  
but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t  sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness  
i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here  
in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards  
and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks ! 
there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time  
the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next  
it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works  
the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse  
i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well  
and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? 
no    okay , 
well i just did ! 
i coulda done without her whole "" romance "" angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods  
try to see how many "" inside "" connections to the king you can guess  
of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind  
i also like these types of "" guy "" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots  
probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure  
now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below  
the elvis songs also recommend this movie ! 
so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender  
i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender  
and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either  
so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film "

1,"when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr  
moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt  
the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department  
the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b  demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones  
in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children  
animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh  
let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off  
dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group  
the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying  
like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices  
danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti  
you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god  
the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments  
the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life  
demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice  
at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters  
we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket  
we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh  
moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew  
 ( "" all i've ever known to be true is a lie , "" moses complains  ) 
after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him  
after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go  
this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production  
it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling  
drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last  
the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun  
the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has  
done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story  
even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family "
1,"i have to admit that i disliked this film initially  
it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood  
that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible  
this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year  
perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality  
i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully  
on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it )  
the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of  
it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom  
and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie )  
the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs  
the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes  
the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion )  
they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography  
the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen  
the only problems come during the first and third acts  
malick takes a little too long to get the film started  
although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in  
the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this  
the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times  
that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible  
the performances are phenominal all around  
the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars  
nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation  
his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him  
caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through  
he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be  
although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent  
as to how it stacks up to "" saving private ryan "" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , "" ryan "" was my first  
it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me "
1,"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film  
despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence  
ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr  cage  
the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films  
`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause  
but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead'  
cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day  
after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends  
he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york  
frank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow    ' he promises )  
frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance  
the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain  
the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation  
and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood  
i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot  
each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality  
the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack  
arquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage  
it's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale  
the movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead'  
although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture  
the incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration  
fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun'  
does `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? 
only occasionally  
some of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice  
those expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort "
1,"capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end    
but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs  
most comedies these days have one flaw  
they're not funny  
they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly  
occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end  
liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny  
this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork  
jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing  
there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away  
but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together  
the son goes with them , of course  
the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality  
then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie  
he gets the wish  
what happens next is sidesplitting  
everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , "" no ! 
i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze ! 
all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! "" 
he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye  
and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture  
carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it's a limited one  
he uses it to great effect in this movie  
there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene )  
he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues  
equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them  
this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end  
the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end  
a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey's character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc  a simple reconciliation would do the trick  
why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ? 
it's not even part of the movie's real agenda "
1,"matthew broderick and high school comedy  
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986  
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world  
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows  
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean  
but election is far different  
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well  
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud  
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school  
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him  
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl  
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body  
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president  
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one  
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company  
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife  
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school  
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school  
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery  
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president  
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts  
so paul agrees and the race is on  
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well  
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing  
well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says  
in election , there are no "" good guys ""  
almost everyone has their own agenda  
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience  
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school "
1,"kevin smith is like a big kid  
his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's  
he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few  
he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups  
smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong  
kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that  
that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed  
great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them  
this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well  
that is not to say smith's message is a bad one  
in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's  
basically , dogmatism is bad  
changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not  
this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point  
smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book  
but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc  ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns  
the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon )  
along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid  
fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery  
the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum  
among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men  
of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself  
they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic  
smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie  
when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke  
the film's humor is uneven  
some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance  
but many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity  
also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away "
1,"david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head  
it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future  
the story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs  
the world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are "" hiding "" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world  
allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group  
as they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun  
she flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard  
unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged  
to inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her  
the events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist , as the "" players "" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot  
here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective  
i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise , which is structured as a computer game , with "" tasks "" that the characters must complete to win the game  
released after "" the matrix "" and "" dark city "" , "" existenz "" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films  
however , "" existenz "" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own  
a combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made "" the matrix "" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade  
 "" existenz "" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling "" dark city "" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining  
 "" existenz "" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored  
after the engaging beginning , it starts to falter  
while i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour  
and indeed , "" existenz "" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another  
but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes  
and jet the film fails on several issues  
probably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life  
this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg's script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown  
existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies  
it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for  
it's a cold , dark place where the "" players "" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will  
it doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about  
david cronenberg has been the creator of "" the fly "" , "" videodrome "" and "" the dead zone "" , so it's not so hard to guess that "" existenz "" is a violent and gory film  
besides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium "

1,"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off  
maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films  
but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film  
it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives  
following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white  
it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne  
cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her  
hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her  
but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually  
cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting    
secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? 
that way nobody gets hurt  ""  
but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us  
hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter  
one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "" been with a black man "" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her  
at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny  
little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's "" just dropping by "" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation  
maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles  
one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look "" as bad as possible "" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars  
there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , "" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs "" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , "" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say  "" 
as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking  
but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps  
indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances  
the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout  
in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings  
the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film  
however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives  
when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions "

- excerpt from twister production notes 
i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before  
i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up ! 
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !

1,"sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston )  
he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him  
but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back  
he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them  
suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back  
on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him  
she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either  
after all , people die every day  
in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on  
the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times  
but we haven't  
griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since "" while you where sleeping ""  
the camera obscura adds a "" special something "" to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy  
everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting  
the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite  
meg ryan , known from "" when harry met sally "" or "" sleepless in seattle "" , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image  
she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl  
even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years "" courage under fire "" where she played a gulf war pilot  
matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality  
the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them  
he has trouble keeping in touch with reality  
after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? 
his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge  
she would do anything to harm anton  
she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them  
that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier  
tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton  
he is , well , repulsive  
that's all there is to say about him  
you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps  
he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef "
1,"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
 "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke  
it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome  
that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio  
from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat  
these movies , particularly "" kiki's delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining  
 "" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home  
this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  
her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  
kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to  
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  
on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service  
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  
kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  
they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  
however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique  
the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's  
this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at  
i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  
some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship  
in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend  
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth  
kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty "
1,"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- 
summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! 
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis  
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town  
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them  
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee  
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely  
unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh  
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story  
the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master  
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours  
longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] 
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell  
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh  
you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you  
matinee is not like that  
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis  
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film  
but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters  
the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west  
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today  
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally  
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink  
the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film  
the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end  
i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic  
they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world  
unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time  
while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap  
several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light  
one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store  
if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here  
another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies "

1,"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it  
my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago  
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot  
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year  
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe  
at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo )  
a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed  
cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood  
weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school  
he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom  
the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist  
if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole  
if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense  "" 
anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here  
once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere  
dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole  
malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth  
the box office success of "" the sixth sense "" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so  
i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but "" the sixth sense "" isn't really a horror film  
at its core , "" the sixth sense "" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems  
some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though  
one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , "" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun "" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head  
osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor  
it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! 
although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life  
if only willis' work were as impressive  
accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date  
 ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , "" the story of us , "" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage )  
writer/director m  night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite  
he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates "

of course , the point in a movie like "" spice world "" isn't plot

 ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that can't be said for a lot of people in films today

1,"it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters  
his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie  
the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast  
it is filled with above-the-title stars  
the cast , for the most part , gives great performances  
john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve  
george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance  
one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration  
the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic  
these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick  
terrence malick is a cinematic legend  
he has often been called "" the j  d  salinger of cinema  "" 
his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures  
after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years  
this film marks his return  
what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment  
the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as "" i'm scared  "" 
the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted  
the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill  
a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured  
many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going  
the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault  
it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table  
this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed  
i'm not declaring that the film has no structure  
while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat  
the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking  
the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice "

1,"the postman delivers but not first class 
the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 
[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner  
even worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable  
read the following with those particular grains of salt  ] 
it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart  
due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms  
although this is the future , it looks like a western  
as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company  
giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders  
running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton )  
the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the "" clan "" 
after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes  
taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either  
once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the "" restored congress of the united states of america ""  
this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants  
food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile  
shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item  
although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through  
the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny  
the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner  
although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted  
it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns  
there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before  
the film is often down-right corny  
a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality  
the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor  
despite the film's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained  
what was the war about ? 
how did civilization change so rapidly ? 
everyone has horses : where did all they come from ? 
the "" law of eights "" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? 
are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ? 
there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense  
the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities  
the evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" , but why ? 
is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? 
why is the general named "" bethlehem "" ? 
there seems to be some reason for that , but what ? 
sometimes the movie feels like a joke  
an army of postal workers armed with guns ? 
considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys  
it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes "
1,"kadosh means sacred in hebrew  
amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one  
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government  
gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel  
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view  
that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are  
the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel  
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief  
it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go  
the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance  
the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace  
the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god  
he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman  
his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom  
she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv  
meir is a talmudic scholar  
his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva  
he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child  
since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage  
she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead  "" 
meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud  
meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah  "" 
all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren  
she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel  
their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor  
rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion  
so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters  
rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life  
she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov  
but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin "
1,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again  
there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice  
 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon  ' "" 
of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  
you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience  
experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  
trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  
juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan  
a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka )  
goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious  
goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen  
the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing  
however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy  
this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems  
take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner  
the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum  
tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room  
she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists  
just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door  
she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience  
this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery  
there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers  
we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet  
the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all  
there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives  
a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor  
surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life  
her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner  
the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this  
in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family "
1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j  e  freeman , as well as the little-seen dr  gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and    winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up )  
there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  
of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun  
the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl )  
what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  
 "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  
 "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller  
 "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir  
 "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares  
jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat  
the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) "

1,"i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club  
a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown  
in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances  
mrs  
doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet  
while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs  
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy  
williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  
one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce  
unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper  
he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman  
daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  
mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so  
the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable  
it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle  
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's  
perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  
there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask  
fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll  
during the film , i was generally too busy laughing  
after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs  
doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place  
daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away  
clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams  
it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name  
he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed  
wisely , he never aims for saintly  
his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity "
1,"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal  
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times  
under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet  
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  
in other words , the sound sucked  
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film  
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together  
there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review  
which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing  
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix  
it is nothing short of stunning visually  
sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good  
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked  
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax  
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster  
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network  
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed  
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose  
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons  
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie  
reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  
newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters  
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular  
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts  
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film  
when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful  
as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film  
acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either "

larry flynt , "" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally  
as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity  
the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in "" patton "" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag  
both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies  
overall , that sums up "" the people vs  
larry flynt  "" 
the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie  
the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati  
there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life  
to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine  
flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt  
they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on "" what guys really want , "" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor  
the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's "" naughtiness  "" 
director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons  
flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives  
an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law  
lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife  
norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior  
in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell  ) 
as keating blathers about flynt's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud  
flynt's other prime foe is rev  jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse  
tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down  
a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l  a  suite , strung out on pain killers  
flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids  
after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene  
 "" the people vs , larry flynt "" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt "

1,"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan  
while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults  
fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family    it's 
just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time  
while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind  
but there is trouble on the horizon  
the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china  
the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army  
the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate  
mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life    by 
secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield  
mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b  d  
wong , singing : donny osmond )  
but she's not alone in her tasks    in 
typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy )  
much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story  
sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it  
the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience  
but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable )  
the animation is on par with some of disney's best  
the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring  
the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable  
at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around "
1,"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen  
nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's "" pulled back in "" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi )  
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang  
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well  
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits  
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects  
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride  
and what follows doesn't disappoint    
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way    
good or bad    
i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely  
of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class  
also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday  
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately  
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles  
delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner  
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important  
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion    
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll  
there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "" rival car thief "" plot line  
as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package  
but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise "

1,"after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit  
spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space  
with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit  
star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative  
remember , the robot ? 
it wasn't one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit  "" 
the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors  
the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk  
cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool  "" 
upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop  
and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes  
as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid  
even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them  
 "" if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three  
turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend  
with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy  
spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker  
stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus  "" 
this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment  
the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget  
the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing  
the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately  
when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion  
 "" mate with her ! "" 
spencer exclaims  
 "" pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all  "" 
the show has many funny twists  
in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form  
soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat  
as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? 
cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious  
the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments  
oh , and eating is pretty funny too "

1,"after a stylistic detour with mrs  
parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption  
while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie  
it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it  
until mrs  
parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies  
i found equinox , his last pre- mrs  
parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating  
i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow  
there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach  
the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch  
in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in  
afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples  
jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle )  
for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level  
all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating  
after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor  
the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne  
a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart  
they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs  
the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable  
the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey  
the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool  
meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains  
the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love  
sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness  
ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves  
the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances  
jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman  
those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity "

in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children )  
it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what "" gattaca "" presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years  
as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired  
vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! )  
but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( "" wings "" ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : "" men in black , "" "" a life less ordinary ""    ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled  
fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life  
since vincent looks a bit like him    
after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job  
there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are  
however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers  
we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is  
however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson  
the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin  
while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences  
what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created  
irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people "

the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury 109  
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison  
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons  
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own  
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here  
the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story  
she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor  
yes , after 57 years ripley has sex  
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well  
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film  
there is a lot more gore in alien 3  
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two  
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 "
1,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death  
this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next    
chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue  
the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr  boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all  
when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit    
and in what room , and with what object  
while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments  
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends  
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go  
the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs  white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest  
and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well  
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video  
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer  
a french language audio track is also available  
the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke )  
also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice  
when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings  
if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times  
so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape    
the first two endings being "" what if ? "" 
endings and the third ending being the actual ending  
now for the dvd release you get two choices "

1,"i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" , wilder's "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick's "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies  
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col  nicholson and col  saito  
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film  
the audience is supposed to applaud col  nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not  
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col  nicholson takes for his men  
 ( the plot by-passes these risks  ) 
that means , the picture isn't perfect "

1,"this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated  
there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story  
this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 )  
this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story  
in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives ""  
one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him  
woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards  
later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room  
since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back  
although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale  
the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup  "" 
if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit  
so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend  
and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr  potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys  
there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader )  
meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar )  
they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan  
he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations  
the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage  
a real effort is made in the technical department  
the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details  the "" cinematography "" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression  
lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on "" jurassic park "" and "" star wars ""  
the film ends with the "" failed takes "" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv  
these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film  
but what in the end makes "" toy story 2 "" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation  
it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself  
it is not difficult to predict that "" toy story 2 "" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected  
unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects "
1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington  
washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar  
jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals  
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter  
through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted  
the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya )  
when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned  
flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison  
the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer  
lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal  
 "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington  
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly  
it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be  
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film  
the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length  
we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost  
washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth  
he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level  
his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor  
norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection  
 "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely  
jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing  
his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage  
jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell "
1,"one of the best movies i've ever seen  
i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now  
for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u  s  it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records  
after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? 
the strength of this film is it's gritty realism  
the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes  
you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real  
i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken  
even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase  
and the ending       whoa  
i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly  
the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific  
the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there  
how could they have chosen between these three actors ? 
there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two  
it's impossible  
kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation  
i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well    what's the word - a twinky ? 
that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly  
the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding  
no cardboard characters here  
the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences "

1,"in december of 1996 , a little movie called "" scream , "" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens  
first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both "" scream "" movies , "" i know what you did last summer , "" "" urban legend , "" etc  ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's "" can't hardly wait  "" 
it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : "" varsity blues , "" "" jawbreaker , "" "" cruel intentions , "" "" simply irresistible , "" "" the rage : carrie 2 , "" and "" the mod squad  "" 
coming april 9 are two more of this type : "" never been kissed "" and "" go , "" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire "" election "" and the teen horror-comedy "" idle hands  "" 
jeesh ! 
out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that  "" 
although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club  "" 
and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she's all that ? "" )  
the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik )  
although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to  
kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger )  
complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey  
as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union )  
at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" )  
since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained  
aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot  
aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings  
as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the '60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her  
even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality  
no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does  
heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles  
one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set  
in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has  
one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal  
allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms  perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good  
although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters  
in one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be   "
1,"james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok  
for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race  
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed  
however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor  
to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born  
in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn  
images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film  
even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines  
in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star  
in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy  
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it  
unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse  
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la  
children watch the flames in a burning television  
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him  
even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence  
all sara can do is await it  
 ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) 
the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too  
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place  
back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's )  
these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans  
true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected  
cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la  
from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done  
arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate  
we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him  
cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot  
while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions  
cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace  
either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time "
1,"synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband  
after uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers  
comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time  
though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it  
it is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence  
this film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory  
for those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour  
nicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities  
as tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants  
serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california  
california , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character  
the real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare  
stormare played the "" really , really evil guy "" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable  
his performance is very chilling  
8 mm's success may hardly be surprising  
it was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin  
before directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down  
8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes  
8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back  
like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater  
welles is searching for answers  
how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? 
when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons  
he just enjoys it  
that , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist  
a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give )  
one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film  
yes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before  
second , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient  
he discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before  
finally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film "
1,"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video  
no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy  
nice guy ed norton jr  ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead  
dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father  
dad was fighting a fire when they shot him  
now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart  
derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence  
at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare  
derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts  
when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch  
cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father  
he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings  
keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation  
derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes  
at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong  
one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for  
outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all  
the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded  
in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp  
 ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r  what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) 
the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief  
derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down  
derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin  
now in prison , derek faces new challenges  
as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me  "" 
there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy  
they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation  
derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid  
when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed "

1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place  
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h  macy )  
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event  
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company  
john c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture "

1,"the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u  s  distribution , thanks to first run features  
although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers  
set in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa )  
as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet  
earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child  
when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children  
nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son )  
bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with  
leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing  
there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration  
almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman  
maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence  
leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances  
one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply  
it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible  
although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another  
ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her  
these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman  
left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer  
refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below  
despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him  
sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? 
in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair  
unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words  
every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else  
for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn't a perfect film  
on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed  
and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before  
mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi "
1,"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences  
you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies  
oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century  
as gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind  
oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure  
at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun  
i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend  
some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it  
like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all  
sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism  
and isn't that the point of the patriot ? 
gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away  
he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! )  
as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields  
but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich )  
forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army  
the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right  
every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment  
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable  
as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done  
clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating  
you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period  
everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge  
it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective  
there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method  
what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington  
played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact  
this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil  
his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic  "" 
i disagree with this accusation  
tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general "

1,"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals  
basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother  
qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship  
however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz ! 
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain  
secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  
i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  
however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale  
natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma  
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  
despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie  
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite  
the film is a treasure to look at  
the visual effects are astonishing 99  8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius "
1,"satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i  e  
 "" dr  
strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i  e  
 "" men in black "" )  
what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time  
the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit  
if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness  
in this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it  
we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking  
this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? 
that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election  
brean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman )  
they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it )  
soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play  
we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary )  
the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news  
the characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque  
for example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee  
motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs  
since it's all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later  
this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise  
but then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , "" this is nothing ! "" 
by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens  
the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film  
every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it  
the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners  
however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject  
as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture  
what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie  
still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt "
1,"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere ""  
the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback ""  
lebowski's passion is bowling  
when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him  
arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse , they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor  
the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there  
when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine  
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers  
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences  
the kidnappers are impossibly inept  
the dude and his cronies are even worse  
every plan goes awry  
you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  
that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter  
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  
the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem "

1,"every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks  
now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films  
so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda  
see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video  
see the best film i have seen in 1996  
not the best children's film    the 
best film  
period  
based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict  
the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books  
when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris )  
but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness  
matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty  
it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda  
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito  
devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images  
in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert  
matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale  
it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them  
there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around  
matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong  "" 
more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave  
it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women  
finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word  
devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house  
the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character  
but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father  
i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted "

1,"renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 )  
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts  
he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort  "" 
the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage  
it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion  
what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring  
yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs  
also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors  
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there  
it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness  
they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts  
she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi )  
she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family  
simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays  
simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view  
screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts  
jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph  d  
in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru  ' 
she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control  
on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this  
to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive  
bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur  
he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him  
odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly  
love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are  
everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be  
there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best  
this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting  
it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice "

1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length  
amazingly , he was right  
titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it  
the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  
fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams  "" 
the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story  
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  
using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  
after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  
in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast  
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  
even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  
in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  
after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair  
never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  
leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  
in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  
when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs  
kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  
the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing  
from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  
if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year  
peter lamont's sets are more than authentic "

wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  
everyweek , wafflemovies  com 
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  
here is a sample review : 
welcome to sarajevo 
in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  
set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  
as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  
joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know  
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane )  
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest  
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  
during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance  
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope  
however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  
unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england  
the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  
they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended  
the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities  
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live "
1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up "

1,"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  
luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation  
otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  
in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times  
those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film  
like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  
perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away  
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  
anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  
and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic  
star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment )  
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  
until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies  
as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood  
serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy  
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  
until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain  
in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey  
but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies  
however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it  
as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s  
after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  
ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s  
george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti  
both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular  
in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it "

1,"plot : this movie takes place over one day  
it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran  
the rookie doesn't know much about "" street justice "" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world ""  
how even cops like themselves have to "" bend the rules "" and "" break the law "" every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys  
critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws  
i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place  
the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of , well    the 
dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there  
of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either  
and therein , lies the fun of the film  
do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? 
well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another  
and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades  
hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top  
and denzel , well , what can you say about mr  washington that hasn't already been said before ? 
he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more  
he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way  
the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it    you 
have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people    move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too "" convenient "" for my taste  
i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene  
but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts  
see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie  
in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone  "

1,"when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better  
nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s  
for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids  
for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for  
feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era  
martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all  
the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights  
the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world  
the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign  
their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre  
losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street  
he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict  
that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi  
as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations  
for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times  
for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade  
brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides  
his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence  
his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain  
however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen  
but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it  
while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel  
wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff ""  
his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade  
other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age  
matthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture  
porno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly "" liberated "" betsy  
even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless "" messages "" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis  
the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end  
travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen "

gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy  
so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help  
 ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause  ) 
gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges  
but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces  
the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime

his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child

1,"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics  
it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story

while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together  
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again  
and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in  
they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon  
but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things  
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself  
we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times  
there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty  
the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship  
there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant  
they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times  
and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape  
but the backbone of the story is the love one  
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight  
as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters  
this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood  
these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother  
i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next  
it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them  
i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively  
the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry  
i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good "
1,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp  
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity  
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste  
 , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way  
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law  
during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war  
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal  
when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal  
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output  
while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27%  
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad  
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do  
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day  
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll  
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany  
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese  
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps  
certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai  
there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it  
then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko  "" 
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa  
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university  
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them  
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad  
it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves  
beating and torture are commonplace events  
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable  
however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house  
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine  
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies "

1,"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible  
people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred  
five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation  
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry  
as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe  
in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution  "" 
each of the five tells his or her story  
their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary  
they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps  
they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope  
each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation  
and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps  
needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining  
by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five  
the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage  
in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration  
the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days  
it's not clear which scene it is  
it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful  
one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars  
there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white  
another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore  
there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say  
but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail  
and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject  
the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful  
x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green  
also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , 
so the richness and detail are impeccable  
the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen  
there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter "

1,"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s  
for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects  
but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  
and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars ""  
the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  
the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 )  
in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  
although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack )  
murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  
through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  
braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  
however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  
the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  
while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish  
this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood  
compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  
braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics  
what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist  
mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero  
wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side  
naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s )  
however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child  
because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be  
mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors  
most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema  
brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol  
david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce  
women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess  
catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on "

1,"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild  
yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen  
mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties  
ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) 
spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times  
fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms  austen originally penned in her novel  ) 
writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes  
from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal  
what ms  rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms  austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny  
the result is a central character that is immediately appealing  
as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work  
at times , ms  rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations  
this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms  o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does  
the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one    
whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? 
fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well  
his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny  
while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending  
other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park    
the slave trade  
there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten  
the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust  
fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy "
1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments

1,"one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film  
his american buffalo is a set-bound piece that has very little plot  
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves  
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work  
unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility  
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games  
it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double-crossing the viewer  
watching the film's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either "" what the heck are they doing ? "" 
or "" why didn't anybody think of that before ? "" 
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job  
it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films  
this is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine  
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera  
now joe has to get out of the business  
it was coming time anyway  
joe's team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) , fran moor ( rebecca pidgeon ) , and pinky pincus ( ricky jay ) is going to split up and go separate ways  
but crime boss bergman ( danny devito ) is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery  
and he has to take along a young kid , the short- fused jimmy silk ( sam rockwell )  
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye  
much of what distinguishes heist is mamet's dialog  
remarkably it serves a double purpose  
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet's special feel for dialog  
hackman has lines like "" everybody needs money  
that's why they call it money  "" 
mamet's timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production  
the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score , which is , in fact , a very similar story  
both are good films , perhaps for some of the same reasons  
but at least on a high level they are much the same story  
the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them  
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 , 2001  
that made the subject matter just a little too timely  
my understanding is that the release will be delayed "
1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )

1," "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition "" 
in 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot  
28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years  
director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition  "" 
the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica  
as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land  
for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety  
shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island  
once on this "" safe "" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization  
he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia  
miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours  
this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen  
in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war  
the title of this fascinating documentary , "" the endurance , "" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world  
it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth  
the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather  
it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men  
with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey  
the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow  
after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on  
considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself  
 ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , "" south , "" an interesting companion piece for "" the endurance  "" 
if shackleton's original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat  
as you watch the story of "" the endurance "" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent  
 ( shackleton's amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself  ) 
there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though  
actor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale  
the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary's first half  
as the crew's adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events  
helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of "" the endurance , "" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition  
i can't think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds "
1,"my filmcritic  com 
colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's  
it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern  
genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i  e  , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues )  
in a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents  
much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here  
is boyish , eccentric "" sam deed from dubuque , iowa "" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ? 
as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted  
the question proves to be moot , at least for a time  
even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : "" he's a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! "" 
neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc  ) , but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities  
 ( don't ask  ) 
it's all a bit much to take in  
ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship  
who ya gonna believe ? 
despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents  
her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "" cute "" to her adoring fans  
being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal "" substantial and sexy  "" 
it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality  
then there's that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable  
look , this stuff is purely subjective  
some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams' hyperactive schtick  
for my money , it's m  tomei with a bullet  
happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker's la jetee , especially with those still framed "" memory "" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout )  
modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan's run  
as the stranger in a strange land , d'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment  
this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) 
at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts "" sam deed "" to the ultimate test  
no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives  
 ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) 
there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy "

1,"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason  
 "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people  
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius  
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  
and he works at mit    as the janitor  
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  
the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it  
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  
and , duh , it's done again  
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will  
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy  
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" )  
finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up  
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not  
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge  
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction  
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 
should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  
i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all  
it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it  
the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together  
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar  
there are tons of individual moments that i adored  
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends  
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  
like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter "
1," "" if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too  "" 
starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus 
in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy  
in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals  
but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge  
crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version  
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven  
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots  
before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years  
in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan  
the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little  
within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways  
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale  
i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong  
and there are ways in which it does  
the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales  
the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes  
probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable  
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness  
one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen  
part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind  
this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery  
the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality  
the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant  
the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly  
the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary  
this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter  
for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes  
she adeptly blends them all together  
there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance  
the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level "

1,"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues  
 "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time  
 "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike  
hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine  
after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception  
he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food  
after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts  
because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy  
realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr  ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time  
it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security  
he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger  
meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind  
 "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience  
the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy  
it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e  t  , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant  "" 
the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy  
the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate  
hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero  
the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed  
the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon  
the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way  
the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief  
fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother  
harry connick jr  does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley  
unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched )  
dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity "

 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while

the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome "

1,"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
directed by robert altman 
some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director ? 
francis ford coppola  
the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather  
the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history  
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask  
but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people  
like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon  
>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone  
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises  
pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman  
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material  
the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases  
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office  
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen  
driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home  
there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for  
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter  
magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course "

saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film  
the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar  
the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding  
but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen  
the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get  
the question is , "" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? "" 
the answer from my point of view is "" no ""  
braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film  
ryan is ten times worse  
expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield  
many in the theater could not bear to watch  
and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year  
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members )  
saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film's primary mission  
captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield  
the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs  ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice  
miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don't yet know him  
they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them  
this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end  
the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own  
spielberg , though not a student of the "" quick cut "" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it  
bay should pay close attention , take copious notes "

in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech  
at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers  
she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in  
drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there  
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here  
in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken  
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from  
the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister  
it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie  
the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls  
with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui )  
he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls  
the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship  
it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home  
things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village  
it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there  
this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also  
but i doubt that  
the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel  
lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl  
the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets  
kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose  
the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film  
the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves  
the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her  
that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts  
it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence  
he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him  
the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god "
1,"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future  
some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence  
>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different  
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact  
maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject  
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red  
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life  
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware  "" 
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths  
the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either  
writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train  
the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family  
as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals  
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit  
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day  
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform  
in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station  
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty  
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn )  
in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging  
she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity  
juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there  
on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience  
but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill  
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less  
it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid  
paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout  
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man  
john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable "
1,"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo  
two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides  
this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba  "" 
patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject  
peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader  
we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men  
images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image  
jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo  
a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader  
his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville  
at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc  
as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto )  
the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more  
lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government  
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination  
the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad  
this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries  
peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's  
 ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them  
some colonial masters were better than others  ) 
the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all  
production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget  
the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique  
the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life  
the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches  
it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona  
the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child  
i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba  
the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it  
high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character "
1,"luckily , some people got starship troopers  
some people knew it was supposed to be silly  
for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 
from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  
i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor  
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned  
first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up  
meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers ""  
four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country  
johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot  
dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for  
if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine  
the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture  
 ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters )  
right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time  
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits  
with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home  
well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it  
that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy  
with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs  
what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc  nothing is taken seriously  
it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so  
it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery  
if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong  
it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2  starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well  
gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy  
yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch  
not since the old "" mr  bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch "

1,"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco  
however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films  
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy  
i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available  
director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s  
this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story  
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete  
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette  
burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner  
horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l  a  home  
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better  
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable  
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his  
as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door  
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l  a  's hardcore film scene  
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends  
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut  
by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams  
boogie nights is not about sex  
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers  
in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all  
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are  
the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world  
yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively  
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion "
1,"you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith'  
it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on  
as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio  
while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded  
but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away  
now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs  
the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi  
on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad'  
in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory  
everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums  
now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again  
with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters  
predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b  
edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear'  
after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice  
not in the least  
norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg  
weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut  
in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence  
stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity  
elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here  
the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice  
`keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick    
though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general  
there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead  
once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful  
stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities  
we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true "
1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year  
it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written  
it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love  
joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc  )  
he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson )  
shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work  
he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel  
this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth )  
shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo  
he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex  
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed  
shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter  
i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care  
he practically overflows with passion in every scene  
fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in  
the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh  
of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with  
stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor )  
the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet  
one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid  
director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director  
i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed  
in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing  
stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time  
there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub  
there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing "
1,"it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film  
i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see  
but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon  
i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell  
i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
i needn+t have worried  
+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_  
surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers  
they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy  
the plot is typical  
thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom  
as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized  
why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty  
he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon )  
he becomes one of the great comic villains  
upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped  
it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself  
would the geek get the girl ? 
puh-lease  
the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there  
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs  
the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame  
and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone  
mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful  
she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w  
earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ )  
mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you  
cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window  
ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser  
braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny  
dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth  
and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) "
1,"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel  
beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action  
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  
as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  
fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel  
lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  
 ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood  ) 
visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy  
fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them  
as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence  
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner  
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors  
most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging  
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie  
sheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside  
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence  
those anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale  
and there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum  
the rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him  
that this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys  
operating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness  
 ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark  ) 
sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard  
there's somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life  
while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion  
 ( just don't ask why andy's favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957  ) 
where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al's toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? 
forget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight  
here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god  
in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death "
1,"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul  
the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman  
you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings  
we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes  
in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry  
shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton )  
when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time  
they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done  
as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape  
the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall )  
in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all  
gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles  
in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center  
and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation  
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop    just 
because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "" 
the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time  
hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them  
a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments  
in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures  
the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time  
hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior  
oh , the irony of it  
tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up  
in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him  
spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction  
mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta  
it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy  
gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him "

1,"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no  
personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies  
i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick  
the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me , there's plenty of it  
a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire  
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted  
cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties  
one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today  
i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home  
that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs  ryan  
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good  
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders  
if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different  
there'd be a phony , "" let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! "" 
attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war  
by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has  
it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission  
the movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers  
hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men  
it's not that way for long  
edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn't available , is the impulsive one  
jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on  
none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg's obvious intention  
i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? 
there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled  ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan  
and of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available ) "

what can we do ? 
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? 
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? 
so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  
it is the land of opportunities  
it is the land of freedom  
but what if it became the new target ? 
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  "" 
then all hell breaks loose in new york  
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians  
a broadway theater is bombed  
hostages are taken at a school  
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! 
f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies  
hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal  
but the attacks escalate  
the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy  
the land is under siege  
they have lost control   a 
terror is coming from within   
what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life  
it reflects reality  
and that's why it makes such an impact  
edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective  
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s "

featuring the voice talents of matt stone , trey parker , mary kay bergman  
rated r  
filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell  
the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy  
instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed  
based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights  
the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words  
when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to "" blame canada , "" wage war against the neighbor country and execute "" terrence and phillip , "" the flatulent actors in the obscene film  
the kids form an alliance they name "" la resistance "" ( with the accent on the third syllable of "" resistance "" ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? ) 
les mis ? rables  
in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) 
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan  
satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see  
satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex  
apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth  
aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like "" shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er "" and "" cartman's mom is a big fat bitch ""  
almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny  
the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i  e  
toilet humor , endless profanity , etc  )  
not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby  
trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it  
cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way  
the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the "" blame canada "" plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them  
the distinctively low-tech "" cardboard "" animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art "" deep canvas "" technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan  
it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does  
the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings  
perhaps not  
having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie  
the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years "

everyone knows it and must make a final peace with the last hours of their lives  
this is an intelligent science fiction film with no special effects , just personalities and ideas

- it is the last night of the planet and several different people are reacting each in their own way to the end  
the film covers 6 pm to midnight  
the main character is patrick played by david mckellan who also wrote and directed  
- reminiscent of on the beach

 ( p  s  
on rereading the 1953 matheson , this film is almost a loose adaptation of that story  
the similarities may be mere coincidence , but they are numerous and they are very striking  ) 
- us release may be problematical  
the title is lackluster and non-memorable , though very appropriate when you know about the film  
also provincial americans may not care about the end of the world coming to toronto  
they probably would feel it would not affect them  
perhaps a pbs release would be possible  
- patrick's family has declared it christmas and are hurt that the ( adult ) children will not spend the whole evening with them

1,"tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end  
all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie  
if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie  
it's hilarious  
how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? 
easy  
write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick  
will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day  
at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to  
the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss  
the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury  
their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury  
grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris  
what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever  
the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive  
the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive  
it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump  
one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will 
and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away  
an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women  
it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now  
ted "" unabomber "" 
kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie  
of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby )  
nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile  
during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris  
definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony  
i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared  
the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone  
more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world  
the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks 
don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down  
i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in 
need of a lot of laughs

after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport

1,"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies  
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes  
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children  "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children  
picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges  
periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over  
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment  
they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured  
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again  
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss  
ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery  
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness  
his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf  
if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot  
the story unfolds slowly and always believably  
each little aspect has its own fascination  
as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task  
he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit  
wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults  
although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles  
one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids  
well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita  
his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story  
the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film  
although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy  
as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning "

1,"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit  
death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example )  
and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had  
scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously  
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise  
the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time  
a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber  
as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original  
paradoxically , there's a lot less gore  
there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails  
craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids  
a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter  
after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little  
scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original  
as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue  
this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream )  
some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters )  
shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders  
craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences  
they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache  
stab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell )  
sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab  
it would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production  
following the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college  
her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever  
once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim  
at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney  
she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her  
also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations  
in addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated "

synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility  
 "" paulie the talking parrot "" ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story  
as a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment  
by attending marie's speech lessons , paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person  
unfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold  
paulie's biggest wish is to return to marie  
many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry  
he is sent to a cruel research facility , where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement  
will misha help paulie get back to marie ? 
opinion : every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well-meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular  
soon enough , "" birthday kid "" loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect  
my sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant  
please think twice before buying one  
okay  back to the story  
in movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing  
paulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human  
actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer )  
paulie is for kids  
while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a "" stupid furball  "" 
sometimes , however , there are statements the kids don't get  
for example , when paulie's elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands ) dies , paulie explains , "" well , one day , the cat got her  "" 
and you hear kids exclaim , "" what cat ? ! "" 
imagine lassie come home , except with a doll-sized human dressed as a bird , and you'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization  
bird tries to get home  
bird meets elderly friend  
bird loses elderly friend  
bird meets eccentric friend  
bird loses eccentric friend  
bird meets bad influence  
and so on and so forth , with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado )  
the bottom line ? 
break out the popcorn money , moms and dads "

1,"jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back  
the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout  
in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year  
 ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you  ) 
in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie  
it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent  
jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it  
jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen  
among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , "" action ! "" 
best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies  
the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was "" stupid "" enough to buy tickets to this movie  
 ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory  ) 
the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet  
guilty  
although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them  
it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny  
jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize  
his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything  
but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success  
his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems  
the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter )  
these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture  
jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long  
one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry  
granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best  
and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far  
no , wait  
forget , `thus far  ' 
it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year  
in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience  
jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 "

1,"airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making  
after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams  
even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few  
but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! 
remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts  
in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high  
films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits  
there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade  
and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film  
this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean  
  
  
it had to do with bad fish  
airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades  
unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart  
he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty )  
in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working  
unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity  
in the midst of it all , something happens  
someone gets sick  
then another  
then another  
soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people  
  
  
and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? 
 ( gee , i wonder ) 
of course the main draw here is the non-stop "" whiz-bang "" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags  
although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing  
the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen  
he's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film  
in a film like this , you're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can't complain about the amateurish quality  
what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker "

1,"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode  
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine  
after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  
again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  
the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design'  
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  
that someone is death  
you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper     
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  
for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  
alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air  
in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  
after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  
but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  
before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer     
is that one helluva premise , or what ? 
`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  
on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that  
unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool  
you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks  
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend'  
after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination'  
low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent "

1,"stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder  
grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento  
boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento  
it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's  
based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer  
visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail  
at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints  
posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins  
a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives  
the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario  
it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration  
the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers  
but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years  
argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences  
effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent  
the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style  
proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers  
the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless  
asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating  
it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts  
thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest  
but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack  
active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts  
it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards  
it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together  
this is a long welcome reunion  
if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax  
but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career

1,"i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer  
it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the "" best movie "" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon  
it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it  
from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  
in spawn , it was the "" living room hell "" conclusion at the end  
in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces  
and all of face/off was pretty dang good  
but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  
i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  
and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review  
back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) 
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc  ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots  
okay , that one was pretty pathetic  ) 
few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find  
this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black  
kind of weird , huh ? ) 
all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell  
i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot    
sorry  
my apologies to o'donnell fans  
i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely  
he decided not to sell them to me , because they were "" innappropriate ""  
hmm     
so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years  
good question  
i'll move on to the movie now "

1,"it was easy to fear the worst  
begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir  
script , you ask ? 
who needs one , kid    
we've got ourselves a formula  
that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction  
then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong    
didn't  
the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years  
under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go  
expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones  
the premise is a simple one  
dr  richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm  
after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run  
his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u  s  marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him  
where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy  
in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience  
in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat  
on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants  
it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget  
later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind  
it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right  
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators  
the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below "

1,"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly  
i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train  "" 
yet it's almost as good  
it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  
elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe )  
without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves  
 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here  
but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby )  
what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  
in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide )  
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  
there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching  
in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done )  
but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  
there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror  
during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? "" 
streeming through my head  
in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this    then 
again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding )  
instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches  
most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation  
his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him  
the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real "
1,"it's an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation )  
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality ? 
what is a sham ? 
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 
reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety  
he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? 
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so  
very surprising for a sci-fi movie  
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect  
this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge  
hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  
unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  
carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  
although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture  
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  
many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  
of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle "

the movie is really a stand alone in that regard

plot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future

they are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip  
eventually , their trek goes awry , and all are "" lost in space ""  
 "" how do get back to earth ? "" 
is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic  
critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6  5/10 ) from the summer of 1997  
it's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance  
admittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line  
having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average  
you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls  
unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? 
yawn ! )  
the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face  
on the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for "" trying "" to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's "" evil "" , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long  
on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is "" paralyzed "" during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that "" somehow "" they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture     very

1,"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines  
the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy  
then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released  
it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort  
while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety  
but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically  
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy  
it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been  
the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia  
if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life  
it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick  
it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set  
kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana  
after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar  
the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other  
when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr  brackett  
everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he's gay  "" 
the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop  
the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf  
naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand  
the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning  
one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding  
the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute  
it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees  
the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay  
it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts  
kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here  
the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully  
every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
 "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 
when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  
this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show  
truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life  
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise  
or so it would seem  
bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life  
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around  
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  
for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  
the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  
balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  
in many ways , mr  niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea  
although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible  
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs  
the system formula  
while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking  
the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing  
there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  
in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  
still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  
i've always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  
cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? 
ms  linney is a delight in the film "
1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight "
1,"contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place  
we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops  
anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead  
it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment  
jodie foster stars as dr  ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals  
and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth  
after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport  
from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook  
the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power  
the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right  
it would be easy for scripters james v  hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane  
in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults  
the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge  
she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge  
we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far  
contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles  
matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot )  
john hurt is effectively creepy as s  r  
hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding  
angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine  
most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr  david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances  
zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape  
always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning  
the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure  
and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump  
effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump "
1,"the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7  5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance  
plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom  
unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) 
caught in his zipper , and misses the big night  
thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her  
once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins  
critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep  
having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics  
this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others  
then again , maybe my expectations were too high  
then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film  
continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together  
this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged  
i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not  
not a good place to be  
having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline  
the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel )  
on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture  
i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting  
also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer  
and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the "" right guy "" ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 )  
i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 )  
i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent  
funny stuff  
also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of "" build me up buttercup "" , which is really cool  
overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes  
little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script "" dust to dust "" into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour  
they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night  
matt dillon is a high school dropout  
in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business "

1,"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen  
as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money  
he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals  
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church  
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses  
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher  
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper  
at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal  
not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears  
he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again  
in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling  
after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple  
re-christening himself as "" the apostle e  f  , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives  
but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress  
duvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear  
in a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers    
but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way  "" 
the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter  
after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual  
his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power

1,"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel  
that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century  
however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h  g  wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences  
the author , h  g  wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour  
whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages  
instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space  
the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration  
first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own  
the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time  
at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time  
they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future  
at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars  
finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions  
when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines  
but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld  
the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times  
for h  g  wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie  
even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era  
compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films  
of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness  
for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today  
some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing  
but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture  
the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby "
1,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true  
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours  
this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity  
instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  
but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy  
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple  
instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane  
there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors  
blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed  
through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  
haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle  
even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool  
the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era  
in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet  
with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are  
it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film  
this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack  
however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film  
the music is especially notable  
the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like  
the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good  
although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles "
1,"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson )  
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment  
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this

killing zoe =========== 
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery  
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers  
he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go  
though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino  
in english and french  
the road to wellville ===================== 
based on the novel by t  coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far  
bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr  john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation  
he also invented the cornflake  
really  
checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy  
leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey  
the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama  
what he ends up with is something that i can't print here  
phew ! 
stargate ======== 
lawrence of arabia meets star wars  
this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else  
director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on  
the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history  
that said , there's still plenty to watch here  
sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader  
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids  
less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame

trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best

1,"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable  
somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through  
set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil )  
an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr  wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st  cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help  
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr  larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics  
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional  
he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly  
larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people  "" 
such is the result of an insulated upbringing  
though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else  
he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it  
befriending a young couple who had come to see dr  larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived  
thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor  
tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions    
many of which he was unaware needed to be asked  
he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing  
michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world  
calling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr  caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine  
delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr  rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins  
director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter  
regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers  
the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers "

1,"you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk  
the title is generic  
it's meaningless  
and i can't believe it's good business  
when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? 
yuck  
the movie itself deserves your attention  
for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down  
only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution  
much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero  
his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold  
in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target  
 ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released  ) 
this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings  
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow  
here's the rundown  
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double  
turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops )  
alain does some investigating  
he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia  
assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa  
that's as much as you need to know  
the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment  
there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species )  
she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as "" acting  "" 
of course , "" acting "" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's )  
the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity  
 ( keep that in mind when planning your date  ) 
the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive  
there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies  
and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action "

1,"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play "" hospitality suite  ''its 
about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation  
he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention  
 "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department  
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite  
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch  
their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical  
following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high  
in this case , it is landing the big kahuna  
they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him  
what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product  
and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each  
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen  
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life  
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ  
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in  
bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion  
to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible  
when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him  
the contrast in their personalities is stark  
larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale  
he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman  
he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out  
he tells him to go on a vacation  
get a woman  
while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long  
he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in "

during a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p  hall , comes to the rescue  
the way in which she does this makes me think irma p  hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now  
however , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them  
vanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life  
williams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career

on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of  
to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed  
a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l  jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life  
price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him    
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break  
price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child  
dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is  
writer/director m  night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense  
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 
for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  
does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 
the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either  
as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  
it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  
for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before  
the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving  
there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger  
the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak  
also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur )  
several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film  
one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers  
the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie  
if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it  
the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment  
willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years  
his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage "

1,"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent  
people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee  
the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves  
the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta  
shanta has a small circle of male admirers  
two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim  
the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das  
 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water  ) 
in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears  
one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along  
he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism  
the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses  
it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter  
the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together  
but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state  
a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees  
another man is murdered  
the group of friends will not meet again  
the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles  
it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully  
the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz  
his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim  
dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him  
but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer  
the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate  
despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things  
the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt  
the story earth tells does not end  
it just stops  
it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction "

during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story  
first , he's an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father  
next , he's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte  
when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later  
william is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins  
william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s  keller )  
kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy  
nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary  
the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful  
his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids  
rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time  
as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self  
the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways  
he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways  
rosmary's trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother  
as much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches  
in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one  
although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast  
a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william  
with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational  
dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex "
1," "" i've been told by several people , 'you're old fashioned  
you want to do everything by hand , ' "" topiary gardener george mendonca complains , defending his continued resort to hand shears in trimming his intricately privet-sculpted animal creations

 "" i know you are  
you know i am  "" 
in some ways the slickest film yet from nonfiction auteur morris ( the thin blue line , a brief history of time ) , fast , cheap & out of control is reportage of the highest order  
journalism students should dream of making connections like these  
cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix  
the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other  
what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand  
one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer  
weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron  
through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience  
the gardener wonders whether , after his death , anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he's devoted half his life to tending  
the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a complicated set of sensory receptors  
the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects , and notes that they may be more suited to long-term survival than people  
and the circus trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by world-renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection )  
starting to detect the patterns ? 
fast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris's late mother and stepfather )  
the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future  
 ( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control  ) 
with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence  
 ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson  ) 
different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream  
by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives  
at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work  
this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen "
1,"if you've ever perused my college comedy diary "" another year in the life of a nerd "" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well  
in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him  
so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room  
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk  
scratch that idea  
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal  
of course , in my case it would be a silent picture  
even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? )  
i'm glad i did  
peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie  
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries  
falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you "" columbo "" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off  
falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die  
the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents  
after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave  
the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( "" communists ! "" )  
the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her  
so , in his grandson's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed    
or am i confusing movie plots again ? 
roommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die  
death , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie  
roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween  
the number can't be counted on one hand , unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation  
and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran )  
i won't come out and say it  
instead , i'll just sit here and hum "" eye of the tiger "" until each and every one of you figures it out  
roommates plays on all the major emotions  
it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry  
movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters "
1,"martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life  
it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker  
this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest  
newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful  
the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others  
on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life  
archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen  
archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world  
archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status  
the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not  
it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions  
there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for  
in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun  
the performances are absolutely breathtaking  
day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take  
pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well  
ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending  
the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory  
scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking  
his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight  
he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery  
his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed  
it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully  
the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere  
he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important  
the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing  
the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world  
there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite  
not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else  
and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end "
1,"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro  
the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt  worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  
comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew  
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good  "" 
after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  
most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best  
let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  let's move to the movie itself  
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew  
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld  
forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show  
this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a  
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state  
the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties  
sound pretty heavy ? 
it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor  
when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous )  
in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at  
the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good  
since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb  
brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series )  
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good "
1,"america has finally gotten what it's needed for years : a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma  
regretfully it's only a movie  
president james marshall ( harrison ford ) is fed up with terrorist activities  
teaming up with the russian government , he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek , a reactionary general ready to re-unite the soviet union under his fascist reign  
during a celebration dinner , marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists  
 "" it's your turn to be afraid , "" he declares  
returning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally  
ultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released  
marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn't exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight  
director wolfgang peterson ( "" das boot "" , "" in the line of fire "" , "" outbreak "" takes the over-used "" die hard "" theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity  
if you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience  
everyone is totally engrossed  
the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it  
oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well  
when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he's over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become  
you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time  
when korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it  
the guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons  
harrison ford has done one role for several years  
his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here  
marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job  
realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act  
ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero  
indiana jones in the oval office  
he and oldman's archetypes match up perfectly  
the other roles also go to accomplished actors  
glenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she's not quite ready for  
dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( "" i'm in charge here ! "" ) 
is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance  
of course the politics are all wrong  
a cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems "

1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure  
 "" it's not our kind , "" he says  
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son  "" 
tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle  
one day , a new animal shows up : humans  
this is where jane comes into the picture  
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas  
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other  
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong  
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them  
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money "
1,"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  
he says to a black congregation ""    if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me  "" ) 
well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy  
beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california  
the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action  
the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days  
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name  
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience  
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up  
since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  
they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  
the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers  
 ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o  j  
fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth  "" 
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  
when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about  ) 
the experience is liberating  
with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  
he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway "

1,"every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections  
such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life  
despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film  
you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick  
will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m  i  t  , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it  
he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer  
he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk  
after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor  
after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems  
in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love  
the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film  
even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character  
alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it  
the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character  
is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? 
of course  
is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? 
usually , yes  
but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? 
not very likely  
come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med  -school 
girls  
will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition  
the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary  
all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways  
damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary  
which leads me to the really good part of the review  
the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting  
i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom  
from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent "

1,"the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups  
for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films )  
for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids  
all in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing  
but first the basics  
based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using  
shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace  
petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides  
he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle  
as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few  
an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain  
lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way  
all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife  
the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! "" ) 
farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds  
shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend  
they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet  
for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well  
the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey  
that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate  "" 
but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney  
the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! "" 
 ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world  "" 
which brings me to disturbing point number one  
i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad  
the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known  
for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day  
and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer  
here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! 
put the past behind you ! 
there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! 
the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad  
beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within  
it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature  
do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? 
the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers "

had "" hedwig and the angry inch "" came out in the '70s , right after david bowie's "" ziggy stardust , "" it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time  
released in the 500 channel , sensory overload world of 2001 , however , the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off-broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention  
i almost missed it  
every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like "" summer catch "" and "" bubble boy "" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run  
but an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn't reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater  
thank goodness for readers like him  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs  
stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , "" bat out of hell "" era meatloaf and "" the rocky horror show , "" without ever seeming like imitations  
as with "" tommy , "" "" hedwig "" tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera  
writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner  
mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u  s  coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch  
while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song  
she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio  
life is an exercise in duality for hansel  
a wall splits his hometown into two parts  
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half  
as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced  
after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him  
alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical  
mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to "" the angry inch "" ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it )

1,"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables  
i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel  
i haven't even seen that  
going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical )  
walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material  
writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film  
liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence  
he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior  
the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself  
nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago  
conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo  
valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict  
javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice  
along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes )  
les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture  
the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular  
basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times )  
many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening  
augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow  
he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately  
i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet )  
this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested  
liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective  
thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one  
rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense  
i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit  
les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture  
my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged  
each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be  
for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture "
1,"imagine this  
you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training  
a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live  
you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die  
you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you  
you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood  
if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow  
eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die  
this is the life of a gladiator  
you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that  
with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire  
and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script  
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited  
>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious  
rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a  d  that is ) waging a war against germania  
scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective  
it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted  
as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who  
it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch  
instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle  
he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life  
but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that  
the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies  
he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators  
all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor  
jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus  
but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes  
now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success "

1,"another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun  
favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women  
the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives  
and all of this is great fun  
swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment  
no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors  
the script , by favreau , is great  
mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex  
the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script  
vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl  
some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature  
vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner  
the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach  ) 
there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence  
embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience  ) 
mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them  
although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends  
they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background  
but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts  
it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles  
the acting is superb  
as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film  
favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny  
graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with  
she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience  
swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws  
firstly , the running time is a bit too short  
the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer  
it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! 
also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 )  
but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy "
1,"available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29  95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j  keeley 
f  w  murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely  
the german director of such classics as "" sunrise "" and "" the last laugh "" died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount  
murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance  
which brings us to "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame  
the plot of "" nosferatu    "" 
is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's "" dracula ""  
the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania  
he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love  
in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding  
arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin  
the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below  
trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie  
this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted  
additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire  
that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself  
the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image  
but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties )  
the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch  
 ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! ) 
the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for  
when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock's castle , we hear a well-timed "" now you're dead ! "" 
from lead singer peter steele  
david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film  
after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest "" black no  1 ""  
of course , "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but "" mina "" --as bram stoker called her--in hutter's letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from "

1,"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc  but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it  
the film's main character , dr  fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category  
one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive  
fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians  
with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate  
this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea  
however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned  
as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other  
when dr  fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn't  "" 
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power  
dr  fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss  
first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father  
next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities  
through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol  
along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith  
as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching  
last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her  
sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns  "" 
 ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor  ) 
he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr  fuentes and domingo "

i don't know why , really  
haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen  
so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
maybe that's going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy  
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok , maybe that's not enough parallels  
so titanic's not in gwtw's league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously well-spent  
the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects  
cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well "
1,"steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker , "" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 )  
much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino  "" 
now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood  
martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned  
his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops  
bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star  
ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously  
he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc  , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance  
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time  
ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities  
 ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l  ron hubbard , founder of scientology  ) 
when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in  
murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage  
always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself  
furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists  
pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly  
murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing  "" 
not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention  
his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry  
 ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr  as bigwig jerry renfro  ) 
martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture  
as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading "" cahiers du cinema , "" or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! )  
most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen  
bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath  
we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem "" chubby rain , "" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush  
 ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out  ) 
these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece "
1,"jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance  
for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  
daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes  
the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine )  
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  
however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society  
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller )  
arlo is not happy with his job  
he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer  
and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her  
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  
gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys  
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  
now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  
to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  
however , this is when he is vulnerable    and 
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  
for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  
zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior  
such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character  
however , there's a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  
that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film  
in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  
however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own "

starring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen 
it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone  
it is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward  
he loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays  
within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced  
a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation  
lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm  
she notes that they haven't finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet  
he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves  
it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness  
this sets the tone for the rest of the movie  
there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity  
there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters  
lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion  
they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy  
their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances  
the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment  
there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love  
their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel  
it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes  
irony would be an injustice  
situations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted  
the emotions are authentic  
if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered  
he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money  
all this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious  
if most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear  
but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length  
i have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not  
it does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing "
1,"every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise  
i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence  
usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo  
it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly  
that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing  
what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history  
princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside  
apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs  worrall ( wendy hughes )  
her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo  
this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr  worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs  worrall  
however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo  
as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner  
it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing  
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr  worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude  
he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs  worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort  
while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed  
he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a "" sensation "" at court  
in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance  
it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show )  
social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment  
the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime  
her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs  worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch  
only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity  
the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky "

i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia  
 "" shine "" was one bookend  
stand by for the other one : "" dead heart ""  
>from the opening credits the theme of division is established  
the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names  
bryan | brown  
in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby  
the local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man's justice "" to the aboriginals  
these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them  
naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback ""  
an eye for an eye  
revenge  
usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh  
brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance  
he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback ""  
 ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish )  
the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line  
he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps  
ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle  
he is part churchman and part politician  
however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there  
whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills

1,"rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity  
starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette  
running time : 130 minutes 
being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma'  
it might just be kevin's best work to date  
it's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't  
in 1994 a little $27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance  
this little film was called 'clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation  
you really can't meet a person on this green earth who has not seen 'clerks'  
it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming  
in 1995 kevin made another movie 'mallrats' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick  
it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 'chasing amy' came out and was kevin's biggest success to date  
now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of 'dogma'  
wow ! what a cast  
ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic  
one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church  
ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances )  
now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels  
salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way  
azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win  
bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith  
what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie  
who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself  
now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart  
yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god  
this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie  
kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie  
of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob  
probably the best characters in movies that i like  
the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while  
the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think "
1,"seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p  m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
 "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see  
it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling  
and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story  
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played  
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting  
mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer  
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally )  
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together  
he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him  
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite  
immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel  
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act  
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit  
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present  
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling  
they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison  
it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does  
technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid  
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story  
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them  
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them  
sometimes they pay off ( i  e  
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i "
1,"eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only  
coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released  
you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox  
let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market  
they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place  
believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p  m  , i saw the little mermaid for the first time  
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom's friends for a couple weeks  
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times  
by the time i got back home , i promised myself i'd never see the movie  
but promises are made to be broken , especially when you're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement  
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games  
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song  
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times  
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells    
the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase  
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans  
she's also dealing with feelings she hasn't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one )  
her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the "" savage "" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating  
what's a king to do , though ? 
the girl's in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn't deter her  
ariel saves the prince's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him  
she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll )  
you know she's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history  
she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr  scholl's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out  
she'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever  
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever "

1,"seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p  m  at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 
modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras  
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative  
but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  
labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll  
for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  
we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc  ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc  is relatively unknown  
the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater  
no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  
we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest  
the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  
first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is  
barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else  
mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  
labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  
obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  
another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  
if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area  
it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? 
labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating  
two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) "
1,"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies  
the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting'  
now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill  
the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house  
if they survive the night they get the money  
if not well you get the jurisdiction  
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake  
but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  
geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  
somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  
eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr  blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways  
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night  
if they can they get the money , if not well they don't  
the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum  
years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr  there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they  
everyone who was in there burned to death  
now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people  
what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night  
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed  
one-by-one the people start to disappear  
conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all  
the people find rooms , which once held mental patients  
rooms which once had people dying  
rooms which may still contain these people  
now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results  
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better "
1,"i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks  
i loved the wedding singer  
but it gets worse  
if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence  
  
  
hell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i'm bound to be lynched  
well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception  
right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ? 
you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about  
after all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? 
well , there's more  
  
  
i actually got choked up , and more than once  
yes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes  
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself  
the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so  
but when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him  
in the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character  
julia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the "" miami vice "" loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn't seem all that interested  
as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women  
it's obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? 
this isn't sleepless in seattle , but i'd actually compare it to that before i'd compare it to happy gilmore  
while the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way  
sandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously  
barrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple  
one scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears  
unfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it's got so much surprise substance packed inside that i'm encouraging everyone to go see it  
in fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar  
the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well )  
sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? )  
while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars "
1,"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made  
a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget  
in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives  
the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together  
michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group  
after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works  
three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married  
after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times  
this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war  
the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act  
the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future  
the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong  
the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river  
this prison , run by the v  c  , 
initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other  
steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate  
michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun  
personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes  
the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated  
michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u  s  army hospital  
michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero  
he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him  
he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam  
the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette  
only in this game , you play for money  
michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him  
the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home "

the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters  
mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material  
the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence  
there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband  
her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end  
finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of  
mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months  
these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh  
we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours  
rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies  
he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants  
but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar  
i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well  
his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons  
he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship  
he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together  
mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting  
my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending  
i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times  
i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious  
however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film "

1,"capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present  
robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando )  
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime  
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens  
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment  
there is no rock score  
there are no ballet- like martial arts  
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script  
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks  
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out  
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe  
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game  
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time  
he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett )  
she has one condition  
he must stay retired from crime  
but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick  
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal  
more and more details seem to complicate the job  
nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton )  
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes  
the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way  
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house  
the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old "" mission impossible "" television series  
we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of "" mission impossible  "" 
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise "" mission impossible "" films  
the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable  
the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be "

based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love  
william parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday  
he has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani )  
william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots    but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he won't be able to talk his way out of  
and he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him  
however , death has a deal to make  
death has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living  
in return , william gets to live a few extra days  
of course , he agrees  
death , under the human name of "" joe black "" , gets to experience life as a complete innocent  
he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter  
and he's not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love  
but , is their affair doomed to an early demise ? 
at nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy  
instead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations  
you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it  
the romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter  
this is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills  
william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and doesn't want to let it go  
by contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest  
she gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character  
as joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted  
granted , he's supposed to be out-of-place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role  
still , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you  
the main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams' company who is joe black's main rival for susan's affections  
weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash  
this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters "
1,"jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u  s  s  
enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek  
gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation  
as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again  
this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f  murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will  
it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists  
of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists  
insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films  
the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group  
in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction  
it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line  
many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat  
the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense  
there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? 
the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f  murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen  
so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible  
but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever  
the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon  
worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films  
no problem so far  
worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up  
in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie  
what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen  
my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones  
while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies  
the special effects are among the best for the star trek series  
the action is plentiful and well done "
1,"anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases    
 ( especially hercules )    
emotion  
all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together  
not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works  
the story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film  
anastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury )  
but anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins  
the grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution  
a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money  
they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia  
dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov  
the plot is actually quite well structured  
there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored  
what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either  
there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses  
there is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film  
however , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly  
the animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators  
not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them  
even without the voices , they act  
the musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style  
as with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits )  
the songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay   "
1,"pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing  
it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience  
don't be fooled  
pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest  
it starts off with blistering intensity  
a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns  
among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely  
there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film  
there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal  
and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns  
the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other  
confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment  
those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh  
fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface  
unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters  
the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory  
or does it ? 
pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up  
just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false  
the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth  
a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations  
i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist  
conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah  
one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed  
imam is forced to reassess his faith  
another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate  
yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group  
it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick  
special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence  
his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick  
they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth "
1,"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war  
broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  
shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society  
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory  
as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces  
like private eriksson ( michael j  fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces  
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  
soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  
he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  
his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power  
in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  
it makes your blood boil  
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well  
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores  
freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role  
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember  
he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers  
colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army  
andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends  
searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake  "" 
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat  
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment  
the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale "
1,"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 
mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus  
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime  
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime  
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness  
sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life  
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  
the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization  
however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead    
shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30%  
this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors    including the patrol labors of sv2  
since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason    and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos  
 ( some wags have compared this to windows 95  ) 
it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it  
as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you  
_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama "
1,"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies  
on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron  
then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott  
however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier )  
after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield  
the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges  
at first , briggs doesn't want to be there  
he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone  
however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature  
the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift  
briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers  
after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished  
and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds  
greenfingers , which is "" inspired by actual events , "" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that  
despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show  
one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent  
of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not "" prison love "" )  
to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace  
i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers  
the movie deals with people and scores on that concept  
it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again  
give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting  
his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption  
owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy  
written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs  
most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs  
the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter "" burns the sunday roast  "" 
nothing is forced in greenfingers  
the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines  
primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps "

[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive "
1,"let's say you live at the end of an airport runway  
large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace  
let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home  
now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth  
wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? 
of course you would  
but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? 
that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale  
unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice  
not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back  
the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest  
in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful  
the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets  
it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film  
i just sat back and enjoyed myself  
the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever  
what makes this film different is its characters  
darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard  
steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers  
the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying  
they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing  
we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection  
screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans  
sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them  
i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works  
i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs  
don't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius  
it's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully  
instead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world  
when they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious  
one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though  
the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time "

1,"who would have thought ? 
jim carrey does drama  
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" 
however , it was an even better premise for a drama  
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  
that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey )  
truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way  
christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world  
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  
there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal  
the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world  
we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past  
it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  
the film can be described in one word : weird  
it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did  
it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it  
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  
the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama  
no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey  
and he showed them all up  
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  
i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination  
he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  
he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening  
he ventures into the wrong elevator  
a light crashes in front of him  
his father comes back and is then pulled away  
we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not  
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  
carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  
laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  
she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point "

1,"in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  
i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  
but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception  
if you haven't yet seen it , go see it  
now  
stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you've seen it , come back  
i'll wait here  
welcome back  
if you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , 
i'm sure you've just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life  
american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream  
it's humorous but it isn't funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production  
mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year's very best  
lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises  
he is living life without a purpose  
he is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence  
he barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live  
but one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter's ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive  
what he sees is the performance by his daughter's friend , the head cheerleader  
he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature  
but for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living  
this crush is only the beginning  
lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( "" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? "" ) , 
buying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be "" beauty "" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs  
his new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor  
and the burnhams's neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum  
ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film's thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title  
colonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime  
kevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel  
he never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life  
spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime  
equally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness "
1,"magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft  
at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film  
it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions  
it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking  
it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers  
director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax  
the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives  
there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants  
there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son  
there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public  
and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process  
given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h  macy )  
a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman )  
hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair  
it is not a pleasant movie  
there is not one bad note in the acting  
it is affecting and layered and wonderful  
there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films  
then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene  
walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing  
robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks  
director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote  
the problem is that he stays on them too long  
julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it  
after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture  
quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around  
and just what is the theme ? 
alienation ? 
hopelessness ? 
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy  
the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events "
1," "" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred ""  
a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off  
but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film  
what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative  
screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions  
no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer  
fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis ""  
the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches  
jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance  
arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state  
what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho  
it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own  
though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school  
we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well  
several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is    well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive  
the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about  
fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film  
the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region  
and the soundtrack ? 
it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else  
as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding  
apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts  
a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience  
even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen  
and the colours ! 
deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast  
the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb  
a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors  
these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked "
1,"in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title  
one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey  
quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat  
the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such  
without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character  
following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  
i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is  
if there were ever a clear case for "" less is more , "" this would be it  
the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene  
by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily  
in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis  
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator  
or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image  
william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , "" well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it  "" 
great stuff  
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible  
we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him  
there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between  
this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down  
he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance  
julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior  
anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion  
this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast  
most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh  
hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst  
it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation  
roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type  
for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass  
whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying "" eight months later , "" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him  
another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air "
1,"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america  
o  j  
simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers  
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms  
and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood  
whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks  
so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat  
however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one  
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it  
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever  
but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting  
a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998  
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations  
his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid  
if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average  
luckily , he has a strong supporting cast  
william h  macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood  
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor  
in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant  
he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film  
he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant  
but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action  
robert duvall is also an underrated actor  
he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey  
duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant  
duvall is magical in this role  
he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way  
in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes "
1,"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens  
however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill  
in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture  
the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps  
peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation  
every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before    in 
other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life  
he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities  
he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself  
everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck  
but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions  
he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing  
he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like  
peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman )    no , 
not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude  
but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing    
as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one  
although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life  
each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible  
yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal  
ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it  
his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity  
he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life  
anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film "
1,"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one  
the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner  
anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration  
the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one  
bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so  
a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye  
after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr  ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie  
but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project  
kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film  
after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge  
the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage  
the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him  
when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes  
these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse  
bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen  
certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny  
no , hilarious  
standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels )  
and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas  
while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles  
masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script  
however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy  
this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's  
murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well  
these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs  
steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it  
this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules  
but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season  
the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits "

1,"notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica  
the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers  
if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards  
starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan 
exotica is a film that grows on retrospection  
exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film  
all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account  
the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction  
exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique  
at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features  
the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films  
similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots  
on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at  
but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life  
exotica is very much worth seeing  
it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december )  
in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release  
apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie  
the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen  
but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica  
analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) 
what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? 
first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means  
the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul     
then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica     
in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen  
exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner "

1,"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create  
christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues  
it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  
as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  
as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  
i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  
the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel  
for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  
both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  
the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  
as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining  
lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference  
screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  
some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  
thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut  
side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  
the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian  
it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous  
despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  
the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman  
whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  
i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  
to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  
one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  
side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don't expect to see them on the soundtrack release  
huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release  
i'm assuming that collins requested the same  
on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source "
1,"a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v  , higgins  
it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie "" fingers "" coyle ( mitchum )  
he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment  
his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age  
he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare  
he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d  a  , but he figured he would never live if he did that  
he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco )  
the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it  
on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm  
coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender  
he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs  
with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time  
he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain  
thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence  
but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer  
warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph  
the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend  
the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up  
coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , "" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world  "" 
dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston  
this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next  
the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder  
there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat  
mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot  
it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them  
mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor  
but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle "
1,"will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius  
for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence  
it's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder  
forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die  
this is no formula movie  
in fact , it's quite fresh and original  
it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck  
will works whatever kind of job he can get  
first he's a janitor , then he works construction  
off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him  
on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion  
lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics  
having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system  
he is firmly rejected  
finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights  
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him  
will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison  
lambeau treats will like a son  
he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics  
he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein  
will isn't really interested in academia  
he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau  
he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart  
meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions  
it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list  
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him  
shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery  
lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college  
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein  
true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks "
1,"an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc  
in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish  
she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint  
a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness  
director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft  
besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend  
he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain  
he shows her as a human being  
in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity  
the only support and hope is in god  
at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers  
this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind  
god is no longer her support  
he has become her obsession  
she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny  
with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls  
after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo  
the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere  
the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience  
besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle  
but the film is far from being flawless  
the script needs a lot of polishing  
except for jeanne , there are no real characters  
and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing  
as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task  
in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost  
jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect  
but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance  
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part  
besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting "
1,"review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag  
but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects  
and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily  
the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get  
michael j  fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts  
he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them  
this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago  
frank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson  
when dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox  
but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead  
this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost  
things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town  
fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that  
so when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer  
fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit  
there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh  
the movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film  
the mix between these genres are perfect  
no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa  
one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman  
but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form  
michael j  fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on  
alvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine  
and jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare  
the frighteners never once feels like it is running long  
the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters  
this movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it  
it's easily the best film of the year , so far "
1," "" the end of the affair "" is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs  
although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience  
based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters  
there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore )  
sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy  
it's all work and no play with him  
while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her  
unfortunately the two break up  
this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present  
it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too  
while this may sound straight forward it's not  
it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love  
all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest  
with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why  
the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan  
even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive  
what's so moving about it you ask ? 
the tragedy of it all  
it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing  
it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect  
everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces  
back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses  
there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are  
it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start  
it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things  
also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan  
i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par  
it just never did anything for me , until now  
when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless  
this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore  
not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value "
1,"john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel  
you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  
it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive  
in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  
about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda  
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie  
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings  
dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl  
feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model  
now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases  
species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist  
forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script  
the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years  
 ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings  
even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet  ) 
the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt  
the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms  
the first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos  
she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be  
her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area  
escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her  
she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960  
the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u  s  government actually had such people on call  
neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided  
whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation's "" counselor cleavage  "" 
the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina  
kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak "

1,"aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads  
the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again  
when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson  
waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang  
as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence  
randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance  
the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within  
i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation  
kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one  
if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d  w  
griffith ( thematically speaking )  
there is not a single likable character in the film  
the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles )  
the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost  
even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects  
the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge  
what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society  
the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable  
damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful  
his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film  
david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads )  
wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly  
sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage  
ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed  
note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism  
the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation  
there are no "" winners "" at the end of this film either  
no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began  
where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls "
1,"razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998  
official release : halloween 
reviewed by vince yim 
`you think you know all about vampires    believe 
me    you 
know f * ck all  ' 
with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly )  
made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being  
so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? 
with that out of the way , let me say this  
this film is bad  
this film is really , really bad  
yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable  
with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade  
still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film  
agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever  
period  
razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film  
the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses )  
but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions  
that is , unless that is intentional  
razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese  
you can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle  
you'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number )  
you'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably  
and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away )  
the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story  
but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find  
as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups "

of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too  
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero  
in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers  
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation  
a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently  
the casting is what puts this film over the top  
the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully

1," "" he's back , and it's about time  "" 
was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know )  
the motto was well chosen  
the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts  
as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who  
is it the acting ? 
hell , no ! 
paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene )  
he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would  
daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr  grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well  
young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent  
the only problem with the acting is eric roberts  
one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion  "" 
but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always    
dress    
for the occasion  "" 
you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor  
executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role  
i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! 
he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him  
is this problem the kisses to the past ? 
they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good  
is it the script or the movie as a whole ? 
the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series  
so what is it ? 
simple : no plot  
the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him  
the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr  grace holloway , doesn't close it by then  
virtually no plot  
i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set "

1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing  
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding  
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 )  
robbie takes it hard  
he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding  
julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to  
eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia  
he really likes her , but she's engaged  
her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand  
julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her  
you know the story  
you've seen it a million times before  
there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story  
and sometimes , it works  
the wedding singer works  
first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective  
actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension "
1,"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film  
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature  
 "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  
and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  
if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives

his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect  
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart  
  
  
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 
the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  
when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  
his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place  
two security guards grab him and throw him out  
truman is really suspicious now  
it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge  
 "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory  
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world

1,"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece  
certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's  
the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war  
 "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history  
the plot is fairly simple  
captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty  
his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice ""  
along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt  col  kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies  
willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives  
willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending  
the movie is visually breathtaking  
the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate  
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening  
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie  
the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character  
the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt  col  who cares more about the surf than about the mission  
it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie  
the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne  
the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz  
coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd  
the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution  
the problems come when the film slows down  
one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess  
the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film  
the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound  
the film slows down to a drag "

1,"reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind  
if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way  
with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation  
it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down  
her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please  
to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills  
eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way  
yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf  
he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him  
however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell  
 "" dear god , "" he prays  
 "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life  "" 
guess who then shows up ? 
she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse  
 "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul  "" 
there's even an escape clause  
if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over  
the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love  
but when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details  
for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else  
apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul  
his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life  
soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal  
given the mischievous nature of the devil , "" bedazzled "" has many amusing moments  
a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance  
he ably assumes various personas  
his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world  
allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her  
hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one  
it's clear that she's having a good time with it all  
yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story "

1,"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen  
this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone  
i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again  
i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s  
in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! 
if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying  
the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives  
in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that  
so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old  
plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator  
his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date  
a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency  
the two do not like each other  
one night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control  
soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer  
critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline  
on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy  
the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man  
but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick  
i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool )  
of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude  
he actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized  
but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly "" sick of seeing "" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! )  
anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue  
i didn't care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did    yum , 
yum ! 
harumph , but i digress  
so let's recap  
a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around  
i can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through "

1,"the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is  
i mean that as the highest compliment  
if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide  
the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence  
along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable  
the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby  
they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair  
complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete  
in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved  
john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong  
claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her  
andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence  
cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train  
it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed  
a pall is cast on the whole affair  
a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments  
in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love  
we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship  
during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could  
all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates  
the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people  
so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky  
or they're reduced to comedic buffoons  
ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is  
they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives  
bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified  
norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept  
we feel for him  
he's a decent man  
sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now "

1,"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america  
this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war  
however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp  
these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning  
as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start  
the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved  
from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r  lee ermey  
apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations  
private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt  
hartman  
the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on  
the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt  
hartman , continues on  
private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor  
he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop  
that is , until sgt  
hartman comes up with a new plan  
he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can  
pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst  
pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine  
after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service  
he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat  
when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start  
joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way  
he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die  
again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not  
a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide  
full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past  
this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others "
1,"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film  
sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride  
i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes  
surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say  
but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i  i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year  
time alone will make that call  
but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side  
we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win  
that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last  
the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot  
unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics  
carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town  
truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers  
there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good  
but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky  
this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program  
what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir  
the soundstage , we're told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space  "" 
truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams  
weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky  
the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence  
his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him  
his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product  
he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town  
one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented  "" 
nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives  
this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way  
by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over  
there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you "
1,"slavery is bad  
after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out  
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film  
during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery  
fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners  
freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt  
after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think  
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states  
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy  
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property  
if they are property , who do they belong to ? 
their masters ? 
the spanish government ? 
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 
the us government ? 
the defendants are pawns in several games  
abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause  
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees  
south carolina senator john c  calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states  
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends  
when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes  
even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims  
at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners  
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court  
the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg  
much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose  
nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human  
it's not hard to see who the bad guys are  
without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult  
he has to make the story interesting  
spielberg succeeds for the most part  
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach  
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle  
there are very few _people_ in the tale "
1,"this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex  
>from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon  
 ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year  ) 
the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive  
a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously  
this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination  
in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime  
however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless  
seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts  
a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate  
the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive  
as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around  
not a good sign    
to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago  
it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it  
something very , very evil    
the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects  
they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot  
the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments  
sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner  
it is his acting skills that help hold this film together  
the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one  
it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur  
however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! ) 
climaxes i've recently witnessed  
overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed  
it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals "
1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary gray's the negotiator  
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l  jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office  
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but    "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did  
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j  t  
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed  
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue  
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman  
the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  
how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability  
almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back  
when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course  
his is an interesting character  
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation  
 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says  
when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be "
1,"the film "" magnolia "" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests  
the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower  
they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart  
the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially  
from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain  
they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness  
whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one  
 "" magnolia "" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of "" boogie nights "" fame  
the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make "" magnolia "" memorable  
however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing  
anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful  
he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long  
any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending  
from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring  
it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot  
this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation  
every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees  
for example , cop john c  reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly  
the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer  
anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing  
the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously  
this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get  
the performances in "" magnolia "" are perfection  
this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting  
anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting  
all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film  
worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance  
he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife  
she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film "

1,"tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently  
the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months  
 "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader  
a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention  
the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine ""  
he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country  
he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950  
the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results  
eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india  
comparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable  
both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt  
 "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story  
in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser  
the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons )  
the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character  
on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts  
some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here  
glossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack  
the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins  
his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail  
especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain  
the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience  
walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience  
martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( "" goodfellas "" , "" taxi driver "" , "" casino "" ) has shifted gears  
something of a thematic follow-up to his "" the last temptation of christ "" , this is his slowest film yet  
oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen  
his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable  
the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations  
philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting  
i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again "
1,"with stars like sigourney weaver ( "" alien "" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc  ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot  
sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller  
helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr  ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak  
incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes  
a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco  
detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first  
copycat "" borrows "" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work  
but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also    
much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama  
even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments    
weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona )  
harry connick jr  , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter  
which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please    )  
copycat is a good thriller  
although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move  
this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts  
nice movie to bring your girlfriend to    "
1,"i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer  
even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen  
but i don't care  
not even a little  
my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great  
2 ) drew barrymore is great  
3 ) the movie is so funny  
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard  
i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers  
sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music  
in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness  
a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone )  
with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress  
she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months  
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans  
soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other  
oh sure , it's trite  
and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience  
what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances  
barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et )  
not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written  
and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen  
naturally , the true star here is sandler  
i think the guy is flat-out hilarious  
he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh  
his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy  
whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into  
as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents  
and the movie is just so funny  
perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him "

1,"film adaptation of hunter s  thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title  
director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7  5/10 ) ) 
 "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam  
plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr  gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race  
during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls  
the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use  
critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess  
if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels  
if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5  5/10 for all those sober dogs )  
note : i have not read thompson's book  
having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level  
this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot  
it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s  thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine  
it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states  
johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop  
during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole  
i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk  
the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr  gonzo  
i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7  5/10 )  
word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible  
plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others  
other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed  
this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream  
and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind "

1,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
we're the fans , not the freaks  
we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down  
all right , stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately , it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good  
anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so )  
his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  
his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  
in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy  "" 
in the phantom menace , we get doo doo  
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away     "" 
this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience "

1,"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being  
even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience  
on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view  
this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life  
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense  
instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters  
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime  
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much  
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible  
distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect  
in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it  
after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film  
fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film  
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images  
characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions  
every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions  
because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life  
even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy  
when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour  
unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics  
lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters  
each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears  
fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people  
because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments  
fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie  
vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies  
fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside  
even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall  
on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene  
this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota "

and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle "

1,"denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances  
this perhaps may be washington's very best to date  
he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly  
his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is  
when his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices  
the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago  
the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history  
he is that amazing  
the problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles  
mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors  
this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars  
denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance  
as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system  
>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit  
then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder  
carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed  
from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america  
after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison  
it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place  
the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released  
the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation  
washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career  
the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it  
in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot  
his anger is heightened to a point of no control  
we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator  
we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head  
from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues  
it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite  
when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts "

1,"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory  
this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this  
not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie  
the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city  
gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  
gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better  
the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  
try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups  
if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher  
in many ways , i was surprised by this movie  
to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was  
don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie  
secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance  
he provided a fantastic performance  
the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense  
gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film  
for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable  
and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is  
writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions  
mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film  
julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories  
he also seems obsessed and in love with her  
but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him  
jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie )  
although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition  
very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr  jonas ( patrick stewart )  
after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton  
the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy  
and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life "
1,"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well  
during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals  
a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one  
  
  
scream 2 ! 
1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! 
a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment  
in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! 
sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater  
meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture  
as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria  
this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what's been done  
  
  
and finish what hasn't ! 
of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies  
this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied  
as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain  
i will note , however , that the "" whodunit ? "" 
did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie  
all the actors outdo themselves here  
we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing  
the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years  
we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place  
the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor  
it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film  
we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks  
it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) 
than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces  
while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption  
as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor  
the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first  
this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities  
if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there  
scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks "

1,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film  
all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this "
1,"you've got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh , the video came out ? 
got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
buy a disney t-shirt ! 
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  
soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense  
when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points  
very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task  
by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too  
as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  
i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  
both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation  
you have to hear it to understand  
interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  
there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  
it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  
artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale "
1,"the question isn't why has grease been reissued  
the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  
no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? 
the answer is not an easy one  
grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era  
the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited  
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening  
but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground  
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider  
what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history  
ok , let's not be a spoilsport  
grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers  
it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career  
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly  
cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur  
between grease and 1996's evita  , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand  
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded  
today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen  
today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed  
secondly , a lack of talent  
performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone  
most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts  
a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world  
he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles  
so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose  
if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals  
perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years  
at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna  
so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals  
let grease be the word that sparks this revival "
1,"what is freedom ? 
how does one determine who is free ? 
in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now  
yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations  
that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama "" amistad "" is about  
through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad ""  
on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew  
however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder  
in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away  
the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back  
the two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves  
the american ship that found the slaves also wants them  
in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free  
they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them  
through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins )  
the film itself is a visual wonder  
spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well  
at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical  
however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag  
the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified  
the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist  
but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning  
it is this emotional force that carries the film  
mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar  
the movie , however , belongs to hounsou  
his emotional intensity is brilliant  
spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating  
the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard  
but that doesn't matter  
the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance  
kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque  
a good job all around "

1,"all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch  
and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season  
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  
the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film  
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  
american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park  
it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny  
american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night  
jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead  
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie    '  
of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner  
there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  
american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it  
i loved the young cast in this movie  
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances  
biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise  
but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father  
scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie  
after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age  
but i never used baked goods  ' 
it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out  
there are some less-than-original aspects of the film  
a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before  
if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect  
secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing "

1,"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly  
since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames  
consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes  
it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn  
carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama  
carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance  
in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality  
he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas  
among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman )  
carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace  
old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake  
carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film  
in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station  
both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely  
yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling  
carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit  
but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion  
you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble  
indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind  "" 
pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy  
sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld  
a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder  
he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct  
he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting  
as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu  
depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas  
he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables  
from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character  
penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story  
still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid "
1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )  
what the hell has happened to him ? 
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  
 "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  
 "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  
 "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film  
even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  
if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him  
 "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  
instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  
and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis  
woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  
much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation  
branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent  
woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent  
branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not  
his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him    sorta  
we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  
he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" )  
as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film "
1,"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire  ? 
there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness  ? 
bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression  ? 
it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story  
 ? 
beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again  ? 
he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane  
 ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers  
 ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto  
 ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest  ? 
 "" you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ? 
 "" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? "" 
the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman  
 ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated  
 ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences  
beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent  ? 
his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself  ? 
here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure  ? 
i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film )  ? 
some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him  ? 
much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it  ? 
it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre  ? 
what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale  
 ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions  
 ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning  
the supporting cast is vast and colorful  ? 
berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles  ? 
don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work  ? 
oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch )  ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections  
is bulworth offensive ? ? 
i suppose some may see it that way  ? 
i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics  ? 
i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story "
1,"synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case  
if she can survive the demanding s  e  a  l  
training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps  
throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie  
review : the title of this movie turned me off at first  
i mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? 
the other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned  
i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor  
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie  
moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men  
the storyline is simple  
anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push  
using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s  e  a  l  
training  
jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength  
the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch  
nonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours  
sure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer  
stepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer  
his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character  
jordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military  
although they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has  
royce ( what is his surname ? 
do we care ? ) 
almost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive  
his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military  
in parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe "

1,"the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials  
with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal  
deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero  
and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington  
 ( a heist comedy ? 
yup  
deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else  ) 
wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid  
ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless  
 ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session  ) 
and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map  
the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness  
nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking )  
instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire  
it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion  
deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages  
it's all : "" what do i love ? 
what is it that brings me joy ? 
baseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat  
he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way  
it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script  
hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous  
this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up  
even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive  
insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have  
the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast  
the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't  
anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside  
denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the "" fad king "" , who handles the profitable "" back-end "" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money  
they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it  
willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious "" ballad of the green berets "" parody  
woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated "" hero "" of the albanian conflict

as reviewed by james brundage 
i'm beginning to get fed up  
over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films  
the good balances the bad  
i try to see both in equal proportions  
but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie  
it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while  
and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify  
far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie  
it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life  
mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in    
california ? 
    
for safe-keeping  
okay  
a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism  
the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif  
the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all  
mark one down  
i'm feeling relaxed  
it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un-creative movie  
but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should  
so that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment  
this is not the film to take a girl on a date to  
it's not the film for you  
it's the film for you and your family  
when you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away  
the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick "
1," "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses  
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted  
after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch  
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! 
there is no goddamned blair witch ! ""  
jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage  
after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet  
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt ""  
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers  
the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold  "" 
this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience  
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening  
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain  
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies  
they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth  
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality  
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods   
documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background  
the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue  
in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel  
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail  
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated  
of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values  
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project ""  
 "" blair witch   "" 
was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation  
in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere  
with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment "
1,"call it touched by a demon  
gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist  
if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven  
in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out  
 ( remember bob ? ) 
the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope  
a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice  
now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around  "" 
shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk  
minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead  
but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel  
and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will  
only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against  
the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger  
as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks  
shadows and night scenes abound  
the days are cloudy and unpromising  
this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men  
fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized  
somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise  
but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check  
nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks  
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual  
of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance  
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick  
sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel  
everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring  
washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film  
it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting "

1,"the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one  
it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his "" attorney "" dr  gonzo ( benito del toro )  
these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path  
duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won  
he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference  
fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs  
it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark  
director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them  
they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles  
the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand  
all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture  
thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important  
now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it  
materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever  
the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment  
in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements  
yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance  
the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations  
unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo  
during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either  
by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner  
duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change  
this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience  
while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that  
there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant  
unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs  
in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism  
indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them  
i'm not sure if he's any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea "
1,"until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie  
forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year  
even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen  
luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001  
so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place  
robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash  
his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere  
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs  harper after he's released and ben is hanged  
but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling  
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time  
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? 
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? 
 ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem  ) 
yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter  
powell's "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? )  
and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style  
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact  
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club  
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears  
he's like the senior class president with an evil streak  
if i ever need to stay awake , i'll just picture him crooning , "" leaning    
leaning     "" 
any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah  
and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop  
it's a testament to both men that they're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we're more scared by what we don't see  
screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act "

1,"some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies  
that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  
such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  
something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c  scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  
one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  
van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home  
however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film  
infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself  
unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless  
things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley )  
almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars  
it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt  
in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience  
for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s  
on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great  
but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons  
the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity  
instead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms  
schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job  
the difference between the two is simply in the line of work  
many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda  
on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest  
in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare  
the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c  scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda  
van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body  
on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin  
even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end  
unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale "
1,"part one of "" the strangest movies ever made "" series at www  mediajunkies  com 
by scott watson 
[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] 
existenz has been called "" a gooey matrix "" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off  
the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , "" real "" reality  
a major difference is that "" the matrix "" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true  
and oh what a reality it is  
david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest  
maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre  
technology is organic , but only some of it  
cars are normal  
gas stations are the same  
cell phones are glowing bug like appendages  
you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a "" pod "" )  
high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters  
a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt  
she is on the run ( from who , i'm still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with "" someone friendly ""  
that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law )  
unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport  
sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game  
luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one  
after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz  
the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( "" it's a sign of the times "" )  
but the plot , while cohesive in it's own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe  
cronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it's up to you to figure out how all these things work  
and that's the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place  
you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you  
there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards  
also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover  
there's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station's name appears to be "" gas ""  
it all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix's virtual world "

1,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  "" 
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things )  
 "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" )  
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it  
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad  
it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one  
after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this  
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side  
this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down  
okay , it is a let-down  
i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good  
but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand  
in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless  
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva  
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light  
for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off  
however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful  
from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical  
no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  
we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer )  
more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work  
juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory  
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before  
>from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden  
but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star  
that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame  
describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death "
1,"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding  
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986  
but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film  
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life  
written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor  
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare  
as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting  
walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob  
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain  
she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits  
she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown  
and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance  
thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters  
the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family  
ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister  
walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious  
when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values  "" 
ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises  
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body  
it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight  
lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry  
lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot  
and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure  
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off  
i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed  
the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia  
joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara )  
alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet  
the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it "
1,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  
probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow  
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it  
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george  
clarence has got his own problems , however  
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by  
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life  
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr  potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  
one christmas , potter gets his chance  
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money  
without the money , the bank must close down  
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide  
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george  
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about  
it's a wonderful life does have its faults  
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men  
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look  
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film  
there are , however , endearing moments in all of this  
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  
the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish  
there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody  
it's a little too nice for my liking , at times  
there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult  
but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done  
capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection "
1,"assume nothing  
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman  
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor  
seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass  
charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes  
the point ? 
to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course  
oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go  
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy  
well , another popular phrase of the 90's is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well  
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind  
why is this ? 
he thinks oscar is gay  
he's not afraid to share this with him either  
oscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth  
the word spreads instantly through town  
will oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? 
one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles  
matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t  v  
comedy "" friends , "" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive  
nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here  
it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here  
her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve  
neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay  
as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character  
unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing  
when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting

1,"when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space  
it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver  
but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks  
if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? 
-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex  
even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery  
the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody  
all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america  
ironically , powers' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! "" 
has almost become an icon of the late 90s  
thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome  
the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life  
it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones  
austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr  evil ( meyers again ) has stolen  
he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr  evil yet again  
surprisingly , the real star is dr  evil rather than austin  
he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie  
perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately  
instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe  
the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more  
by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites  
even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like "" do you smoke after sex ? "" 
 "" i don't know , baby , i never looked  "" 
this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny  
i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious "" just the two of us "" rendition by dr  evil and his new miniature clone named "" mini-me ""  
i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort  
indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did  
but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  
the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other  
both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  
however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  
the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p  j  hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  
the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  
for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background  
my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one  
my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  
in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too  
the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality  
throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  
there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments  
my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne  
this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms  roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms  roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable  
even better than ms  roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding  
with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film  
she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself ""  
rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film  
his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr "

1,"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered  
with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols  
their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness  
less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue  
not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development  
that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level  
the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis  
intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "" human interconnectedness "" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me )  
shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene  
those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself  
adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london  
every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives  
he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years  
she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction  
they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation  
as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines  
in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy  
if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment  
chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train  
the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines  
these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes  
separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center  
despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image  
intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw  
an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration )  
as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk  
bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with  
his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations  
in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best  
he's that good "
1,"for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow  
firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship  
secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes  
thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose  
finally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing  
of these four , the last one can be a nightmare  
meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression  
if you're lucky , things will go smoothly  
but , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong  
and with a name like that , how could it not ? 
when greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive  
when he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , "" not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? "" 
it's definitely not a good start  
but greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie  
he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner  
it doesn't matter that he's jewish  
if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do  
 "" oh god    you're 
such a good god "" , he moons  
his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the "" deniro squint "" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin  
things get progressively worse for greg  
and that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart  
eventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people  
it's a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes  
he buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances  
he tries to find jack's missing cat  
but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble  
and there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness  
the more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy  
we liked greg "

1,"by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining  
to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement  
the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed  
this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring  
the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  
as mrs  paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  
to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  
stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband  
 "" a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial  
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister  
 "" she's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty  
 "" she's too fine a woman  "" 
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd )  
unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama  
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  
she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradine's portrait nearby  
in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires  
to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs  paradine acquitted because , if mrs  paradine dies , his heart will go with her  
if she is freed , he will be able to forget her  
as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr  paradine's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships  
charles coburn plays anthony's legal partner , sir simon flaquer  
and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield  
this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins "

1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore "

1,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living  
he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings  
on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks  
fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt  
for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives  
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle  
alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility  
the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident  
the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it  
however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through  
he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger  
and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money  
however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money  
he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents  
he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner  
his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years  
she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for  
 "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her  
in his mind , his daughter is dead  
the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own  
however , not everyone in town wants it to happen  
billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it  
he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman  
he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds  
to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way  
central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it  
aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out  
it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled  
obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck  
her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) "
1,"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is 100% intensity  
it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling  
 "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away  "" 
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 ""  
 "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real  
it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife )  
however , none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege  
the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath  
incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  
it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away  
as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  
anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it  
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  
they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death  
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  
if they didn't , it would be one short movie ! 
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story "
1,"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office  
during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope  
 "" ben-hur  "" 
 "" cleopatra  "" 
 "" the robe  "" 
 "" sparticus  "" 
 "" the fall of the roman empire  "" 
 "" quo vadis  "" 
sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood  
since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" )  
yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now  
 "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a  d  180  
roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting  
however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again  
when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered  
maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son  
a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa  
 ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained  ) 
an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds  
proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena  
of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads  
when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete  
our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen )  
the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess  
also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger  
it's a simple tale of good versus evil  
maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family  
commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience "

he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under  
when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one  
it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in "" session 9  "" 
gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there  
their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum  
but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store  
as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen  
gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him  
phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend  
mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret  
gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital  
as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital  
tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away  
but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all  
i don't want to give away too much of the story of "" session 9 , "" so i'll stop there  
what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of "" halloween "" and "" friday the thirteenth  "" 
there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror  
with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is "" frightening  "" 
as i watched "" session 9 "" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie  
the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his "" next stop wonderland "" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud  
music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying  
couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of "" the shining , "" "" the blair witch project "" and , even "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick  
additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation  
acting is another factor that raises "" session 9 "" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like "" scream , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" and their sequels  
those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror  
anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable  
mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital  
the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem  
david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is "
1,"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989  
whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed  
the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up  
someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition  
now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind  
the plot is thus  
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris )  
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u  s  nuclear submarine  
requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn )  
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren't speaking russian ""  
meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u  s  navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions  
this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them  
the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens  
the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding  
and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established  
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss  
the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects  
one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile  
the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war  
with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story's climax is now given real weight  
why on earth were they left out of the original ? 
this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible  
so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent  
i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain  
the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag  
nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2  see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound "
1,"naturally , at the core of leon gast's "" when we were kings "" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was  
thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman  
fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore  
with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life  
but "" when we were kings "" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match  
questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary  
gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali  
a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast's film with a forceful swipe at the united states  
when ali hollers "" damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind  
his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : "" no viet cong ever called me nigger "" , ali reasons  
despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of "" when we were kings "" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion  
listening to the film's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this "" rumble in the jungle "" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map  
spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a "" coming home "" to africa  
foreman reminds us that africa is the "" cradle of civilisation ""  
fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality  
it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator  
while ali respects mobutu's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers  
mailer's insights are lost on most of the film's commentators  
george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire  
with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire' s squalid ruling elite  
mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power  
don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the "" messiah "" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity  
understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal  
he may be , as one sympathiser notes , "" blacker "" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king  
africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity  
little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali's opponent wasn't white  
admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored  
the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time  
there is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified

1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is

this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    
before she is abducted  
dr  kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself  
because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  
after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out  
when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  
after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice  
from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive "
1,"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action  
mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year  
the film is based upon the comic book series "" the flaming carrot "" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear )  
things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city  
well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance  
this is where the film takes a turn for the better  
in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes  
 "" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , "" mr  furious ( ben stiller ) and "" the shoveller ( william h  macy )  
sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast  
that is until they aquire "" invisible boy "" ( kel mitchell ) , and "" the bowler "" ( janeane garafalo ) and "" mr  splein "" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess  
thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen  
the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest  
for one , the film is considerably clever  
it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc  in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way  
a part of the cleverness comes from the cast  
sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here  
while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out  
one was paul reuben  
no matter how disgusting or revolting "" mr  splein "" may be , you still can't help but laugh  
it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions  
janeane garafalo also was an interesting character  
she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing  
men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes  
on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off  
kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless "

1,"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash  "" 
on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork  
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it )  
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 )  
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive  
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident  
you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it  
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes  
in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police )  
soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex  
while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge  
i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex  
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp  
then when it happens , we hold our breath  
the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion "

1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner  
in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making  
his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video  ) 
many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist  
it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power  
it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  
an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value  
the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation  
you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    
and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  
showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness "

1,"in 1977 , something never though possible happened  
the film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects  
the film set a new standard for special effects in film  
not only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself  
the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever  
the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi  
the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side  
darth vader is the leader of the dark side  
ben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today  
darth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side  
years after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble  
r2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call "" driods "" , or robots that are of assistance to humans  
while an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship  
to obi-wan kenobi pleading for help  
the princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine  
the jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell  
they are bought by luke skywalker's ( mark hamill ) family  
while luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found  
luke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke's father , who is now dead  
luke also learns his family was a jedi  
after luke's family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all  
ben wants to create a new jedi  
first , the two must find princess leia and serve her  
han solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary  
after meeting up with leia , the film really picks up  
luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur  
star wars is an amazing epic  
the plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it  
the special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic  
the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch "
1,"in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid  
from that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years  
the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist  
the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen  
special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills "" verbal "" kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims  
kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead  
kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city  
along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible  
together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "" new york's finest taxi service "" --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins  
what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze  
the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater  
the cast is exceptional  
palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there  
byrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster  
del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny  
baldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm  
pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor  
however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey  
spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze  
spacey's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years  
verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy  
the film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes  
what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least  
the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous  
you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do  
kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle  
mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb  
without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end  
we do  
this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created "
1," "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie  
despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here  
instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation  
based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story  
brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice  
his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement  
osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base  
when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning  
brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end  
searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite  
harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam  
he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm  
osnard offers harry a way out  
he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele  
eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing  
before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director  
harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own  
osnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal  
the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d  c  over how to best protect the vital waterway  
meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker  
and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies  
geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor  
rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity  
after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems  
although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her  
of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence  
curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles  
speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here "

1,"fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town  
joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago  
he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her  
she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher  
before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye  
a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station  
driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand  
but the deputy sheriff "" buggs "" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him  
he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl  
the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect  
locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence  
in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping  
fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell  
the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him  
somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies  
katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died  
the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses  
joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge  
he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob  
an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder  
katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death  
the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse  
the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail  
the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob  
but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film  
as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe  
in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive  
when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened  
katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have  
but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive "
1,"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u  s  , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream  
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up  
did it live up to the first film ? 
the answer is no  
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  
she has been so upset since the incident  
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on  
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle  
karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer  
freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago  
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas  
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island  
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  
something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though  
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time  
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film  
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive  
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  
let's start with settle  
matthew is completely fake in this film  
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one  
he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film "
1,"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies  
from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc  )  
when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? 
it just seemed cheap to me  
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude  
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie  
if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen  
this is part of the fun of watching scream  
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers  
to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film  
there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though  
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics  
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive  
from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories  
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream  
the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's  
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors  
scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson  
within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie  
mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat )  
not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors  
the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction  
in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement  
i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies  
i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety  
however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong  "
1,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds  
that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon )  
but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way  
the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays  
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse  
the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty  
kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve  
he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him  
the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle  
the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin  
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back  
the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night  
on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again  
that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport  
in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him  
it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children  
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class  
they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child  
meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true  
he's finally rid of his family ! 
life is a dream come true  
he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box  
slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane  
he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" )  
he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring  
the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house  
macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor  
still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing  
for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car  
kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa  
he learned how to deal with the furnace "

1,"i can hear the question already  
what on earth do these two movies have in common ? 
to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors  
as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers  
but oh , how differently the packages affect their films  
while "" everyone's "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is  
i left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face  
i left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less  
 "" everyone "" features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise  
woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again  
similar situations happen to his family and friends  
some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films  
the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut  
however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits  
in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important  
yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story  
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling  
and what better way to express feeling than through music ? 
love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart  
some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there  
it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him  
their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional )  
but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience  
granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders  
jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in "" portrait of a lady , "" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one  
campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind  
unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting  
i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people  
even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten  
the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material  
it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone  
the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them "
1,"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x  when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them  
he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years  
 "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake  
we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides  
or at least , that's the intention  
the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him  
when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere  
coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair  
he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up  
he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle  
but danny won't  
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago  
the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white  
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  
to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them  
and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true  
 "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  
in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year  
one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving )  
another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison  
and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  
there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time )  
norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  
in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best "

1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
 : - ) )  
well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here ? 
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance  
it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable  
there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? 
gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films  
but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" )  
is it overdone ? 
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half "

1,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult  
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives  
but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome  
`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood  
the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte )  
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface  
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me  
but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head  
we see that he is a mean-tempered person  
he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him  
he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence  
he also has tremendous problems with relationships  
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter  
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her  
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him  
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk  
she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point  
finally , he is spiteful and vindictive  
as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless  
as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died  
we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain  
he is a prisoner and a slave to it  
he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension  
what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? 
we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn )  
this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet  
he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist  
we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks  
to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person  
very effective  
today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man "
1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do  
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well  
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar  
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment  
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction  
these people are having the time of their lives  
 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies  ) 
the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans  
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong  
filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions  
at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel  
after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left  
they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus  "" 
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too "
1," "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline  
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter  
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally  
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on  
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  
directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses  
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  
the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close  
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche  
as such , there is no real story  
i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  
he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  
as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero  
he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him  
it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents )  
 "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life  
bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor  
he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig )  
bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning  
george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason  
the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another  
while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant  
bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings  
while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there  
the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  
once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together  
i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was  
someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in  
thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother  
i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain "
1,"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club  
both films consist of a predominately male cast  
both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires  
and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped  
while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation  
a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire  
paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types  
as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology  
boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages  
another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks  
some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true  
if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend  
if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room  
giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth  
after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt )  
he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers  
learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true  
after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company  
at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on  
ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad  
the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves  
the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film  
the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless  
ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt  
the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring  
the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens  
there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable  
due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into  
the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy  
in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director )  
indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr  williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained  ) 
and , much like mr  tarantino's screenwriting , mr  williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr  williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  
while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging  
like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie )  
however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen )  
there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney  
they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded  
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 
there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms  buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) "

1,"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system  
some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is  
however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear  
beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u  s  senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history  
bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party  
once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington  
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium     
blah , blah , blah  "" 
when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become  
in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place  
knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general  
at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u  s  unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife  "" 
later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule  "" 
all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment  
platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet  
his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason  
when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews  
at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience  
bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally  
she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l  d  
 ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign  
some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) "
1,"at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie  
on second glance it looks that way too  
although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad  
admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure )  
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? "" 
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film  
sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team  
by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film  
 "" what disaster is that ? "" 
you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat  
glad you asked  
through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city  
the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel  
good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it  
sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside  
so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak  
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie  
not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again )  
daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star  
amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper  
oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too  
sage -- nice name  
i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley  
note to sage -- you are still young  
go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting  
the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable  
mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks  
the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie  
as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one  
i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable  
adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing  
why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? 
would this be too much to ask ? 
can't we all just get along ? 
special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better "
1,"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia  
although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones  
until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters  
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times  
one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l  a  
the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot  
rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l  a  being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected  
richard chance ( william l  petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters  
however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another  
finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money  
being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier  
their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway  
like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life  
gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent  
that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood  
secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times  
ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie  
willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable  
compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers  
instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end  
in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered )  
the dark atmosphere of l  a  - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills  
the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase  
that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film "
1,"the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains  
we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape  
they kiss , then walk on  
one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls  
the glass on his mask cracks  
his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop      
then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up  
it's all been a dream  
he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins    
total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot  
quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised  
one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself  
quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan  
the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing  
however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him  
quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend'  
he get's his ass to mars  
mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air  
against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants  
the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air  
eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him  
throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie  
naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding  
as you can tell , it's violent stuff "

 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser  
and they're right  
i have lost something  
i didn't always feel this sedated  "" 
with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  
lester works for an advertising agency  
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering  
estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy  
carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker  
she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings  
but inside she is desperate  
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  
the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter  
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  
this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple  
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  
most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  
she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  
colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man  
his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's  
in fact they are the next door neighbors  
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty ""  
alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years

1,"capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers  
wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis  
what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? 
how much did he know about crimes against humanity ? 
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation  
 , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists  
szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope  
it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them  
ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich  
maj  steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor  
when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen  
after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes  
he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty  
from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra  
as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation  
there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting  
perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed  
if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth  
in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler  
where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous  
it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act  
when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation  
perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is  
we are given clues to something but they are never tied up  
in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler  
the film is basically a stage play  
the visual is not very important  
corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location  
as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing  
i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale  
[there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice "
1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open  
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful  
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy  
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated  
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog )  
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth  
tobey maguire fits well in the role  
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants  
this is a plot line i had trouble with  
douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  
at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  
seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  
suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  
there is a movie in there somewhere  
grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor  
okay , maybe not so chivalrous  
there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word  
lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" "

1,"i rented this movie with very high hopes  
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking  
first of all , the casting for this film is great  
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood  
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability  
william h  macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones  
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife  
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood  
joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom  
her character is the most ambitious  
she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that  
her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better  
as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance  
his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction  
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable  
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance  
the movie is very provocative  
it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today  
i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing  
they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace  
the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length  
some films are not meant to be that long  
pleasantville is one of those films  
this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it  
first , they are amazed by the implementation of color  
then they want to have it

people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it  
i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused  
it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history  
anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless  
it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic  
the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated  
but that does not mean that the film itself is bad  
in fact , it is terrific  
i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash  
it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place  
the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo  
the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate  
unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene  
on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  
he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi  
as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker  
>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie  
around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul  
i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this  
this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks  
he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" 
and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying  
the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph  
if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement  
the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie ""  
what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams  
even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant  
his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling  
the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia  
when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 "

it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption  
the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing  
kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job  
when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department  
minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops  
jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j  
t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner  
it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor  
jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight  
disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here  
there , trouble arises  
and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head  
there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam  
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff  
kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses  
so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect  
suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one  
not many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them  
as an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes  
although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with  
faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is  
what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow  
mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair  
contrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance  
after breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety  
the villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective  
the baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder "
1,"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers  
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture  
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's  
 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for  
smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal  
 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband  ) 
smart's got a point  
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version  
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later  
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman  
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb  
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv  ' 
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon  
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily  
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne  
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture  
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates  
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell  
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way  
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law  
 "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head  "" 
her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters  
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks  
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix  
he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors  
kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland  
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course )  
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever  
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him  
gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs  
larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s  
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky  
cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati  
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter  
this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history  
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost  
the people vs  
larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations  
considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs  
larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous  
much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity  
the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs  
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea  
larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side  
there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking  
ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other  
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt  
harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film  
courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive  
it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on  
edward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs  
larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film  
one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges  
milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic  
there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining  
two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs  
larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech "
1,"after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino  
it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  
luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  
the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  
she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary  
but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope  
jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l  jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation  
soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda )  
also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say )  
the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands  
it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so  
there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters  
the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof  
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie  
a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? 
you've got to commend the acting  
jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting  
the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes  
tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  
also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear  
jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath  
you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary  
the acting is the glue that holds everything together  
grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character  
in fact , she's flat-out great  
another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so  
michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge  
speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied  
there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie  
which is a life-saver for mr "

1,"in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well  
yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it  
i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out  
it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering  
so , i shrugged , thought , "" hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , "" so i signed up  
all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either  
rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? 
you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey  
sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed  
when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out  
there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature  
in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors  
the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup  
subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled  
we meet all the important people    toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others  
we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons  
and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_  
and it's a big one  
>from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue  
and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style  
again    there's 
nothing new here  
and yet there doesn't need to be  
the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution  
the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together  
once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way "

1,"well i'll be damned    
the canadians can make a good movie  
the world is coming to an end  
we don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it  
the world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations  
yet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on  
they aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets  
instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end    
some engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone  
these people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours  
writer-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film  
all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth  
craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success  
even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer  
things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film    
some moments are understandably gut-wrenching )  
the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end  
i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway )  
but i do wonder why the sun never sets  
come midnight , the sun is still shining brightly  
maybe the sun is crashing into the earth

1,"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids  
although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind  
and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit  
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story  
nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a  k  a  robin hood  
flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself  
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household  
the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more  
i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review  
simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler  
robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch  
although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level  
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor  
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows  
in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country  
robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids  
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones  
filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players  
in scene after scene the picture charms the audience  
who wouldn't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained  
and , of course , he doesn't just win , he does so by splitting the other man's arrow  
watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments  
sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role  
and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy  
as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks  
bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing  
the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures "

be forewarned  
james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr  ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr  , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour  
whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly  
 ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag  ) 
double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs  
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film  
however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat  
subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious  
if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr  , whose versatility is put to the test in this film "
1,"what a great film  
what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film  
>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy  
a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way  
they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day  
heil ! 
heil ! 
huh ? 
shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces  
this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives  
granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece  
i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character  
benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race  
benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept  
it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema  
there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly  
slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed  
and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in  
this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family  
the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported  
guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child  
for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right  
for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds  
which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? 
with persecution ? 
with injustice on the worst level ? 
it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had  
other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim  
sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds  
benigni+s guido realizes this  
he is the clown , but he is not a fool  
he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh  
his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him  
it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor  
perhaps that is a form of denial  
perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) "

1,"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  
this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart  
in fact it's not even a comedy  
it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs  
based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness  
rob gordon was a dj  
it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life  
now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york  
when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose  
decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important  
he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists ""  
and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  
though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first  
where did he go wrong ? 
was it he that screwed up ? 
or maybe life just stinks ? 
while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together  
with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me  
although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word  
and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  
he is simply superb  
it is as much his movie as it is frears'  
the film would not be the same without him  
cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony  
most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off  
his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen  
the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job  
both ______ and jack black are fabulous  
even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful  
however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick  
this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination  
he is simply a joy to behold  
otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend "
1," ( dimension films , "" scream 2 "" 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot  
that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first )  ) 
 "" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , "" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller "" scream , "" her statement referring to the films of the "" nightmare on elm street "" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general  
the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas  
but like it or not , along comes "" scream 2  "" and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions  
 "" scream 2 "" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride  
it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california  
those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives  
plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along  
trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called "" stab  "" 
and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during "" scream , "" has left his job as a police officer for a while  
life is tranquil    
at least for a while  
several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one  
thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student  
cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? 
like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang  
this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of "" stab , "" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema  
before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from "" stab "" which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear  
 ( "" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! "" 
pinkett yells at the screen  ) 
it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road  
another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters  
there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect  
there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count  
it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar  
it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier  
it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films )  
sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects , "" "" aliens "" and "" the empire strikes back "
1," "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold  "" 
starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong 
eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love  
neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough  
and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films  
slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york  
when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver  
he does not seem particularly out of place  
in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home  
he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they're american ) --the tokens of his success  
he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb )  
he loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village  
when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father  
all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl  
but eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable  
director mabel cheung ( an autumn's tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home  
slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language  
seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home  
the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic  
on his way to his parent's village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man  
slim and odds-and-ends fall for each other  
that's predictable  
the manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not  
the emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma  
it's typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover  
but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot  
the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick  
eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight  
when odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , "" it's all the same  
wherever we go , we'll be in chinatown , "" and her straightforward statement expresses much  
there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american "
1,"james l  brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy  
nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen  
he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone  
so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t  v 
sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 )  
naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end  
like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy  
nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish  
only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers  
hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson  
there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them  
kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character  
although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together  
in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson  
but then again , pets are always cute on screen  
providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun  
he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying  
smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role  
even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor  
but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it  
he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol  
and this is the films main problem  
it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin  
she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him  
also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly  
i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person  
it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out  
brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience  
he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good "

mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for  
i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals  
sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's "" all that jazz "" and "" cabaret , "" but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from "" the rocky horror picture show "" and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols

1,"there seem to be two reactions to dark city  
you either love it or you are unimpressed  
count me as a "" love it  "" 
as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better  
where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal  
it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent  
not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone  
a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe  
surprised , the attacker runs off  
the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room  
a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing  
ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare  
an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i  d  
the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch  
now if only he could remember the rest of his life     
dark city is good on many levels  
first , the look of the movie is excellent  
give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements  
there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements  
it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks  
proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls )  
the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay  
second , the editing of the film is good  
the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments  
also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look  
third , the special effects are well used "
1,"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  
but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending  
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
yes , it's all about the suits , fellas    the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but that's not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other  
you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is , their boss  
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  
but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  
of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 
 ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) 
in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing  
scary shite  
but there's an ever better scene than that in this film  
this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear )  
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? )  
but the flick's not perfect  
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( "" "

robocop takes place in detroit in the future  
things are pretty bleak  
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force  
peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen  
peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed  
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter  
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after  
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace  
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting  
the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop  
nancy allen does a decent job  
this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly  
but they made one anyway  
enter    
robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner 
detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film  
ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals  
most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city  
this film is pretty bizaare  
it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor  
the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so  
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up  
the effects are still decent though  
this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals

they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind  
you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch  
in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others  
beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones  
they live their lives in front of the television  
the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen  
this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone  
beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there  
the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television  
even at this point they have no idea what has happened  
they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television  
before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid  
this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film  
eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television  
luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife  
this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife ""  
beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife  
they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her ""  
to them , this is the best day of their lives  
not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv  
inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi  
oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds  
they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc  
the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it  
at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself  
beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives  
they even get to meet the president  
but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity  
this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them "

1,"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates  
geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery  
needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 
i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan )  
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? )  
bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 
this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  
it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema  
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  
oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books )  
but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show  
along with the pig , of course ! 
anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  
there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine  
he succeeds , but    she 
knocks the glass over ! 
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! 
in the immortal words of homer j  simpson - "" d'oh ! ! "" 
other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house  
we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home    he 
realises this and tries to get back to his room    cut 
to the car again , she's getting near   "
1,"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism  
everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time  
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere  
i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes  
while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- ""   and 
they lived happily ever after   ""  
and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air  
however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues  
in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking  
somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead  
here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912  
lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model  
she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years  
as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher )  
on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e  j  
smith ( bernard hill )  
on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive  
a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death  
cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself  
the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera  
the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script  
because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking  
russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy  
everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch  
but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them  
the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake "
1,"there's good news and bad news about mulan  
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules  
on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast  
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king  
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians  
mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married  
that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her  
cartoons    
meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns  
since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go  
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family  
that's chinese culture for you    
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place  
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army  
it should have been called g  i  
chang  
mulan calls on her ancestors for help  
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up  
voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges  
murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have  
you ain't never had a friend like mushu  
speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this  
disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go   "
1,"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california  
there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy  
when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled  
dan gauthier , gugino's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino  
gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore  
she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end  
forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son-in-law is the film to see this summer  
son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez  
when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then  
this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it  
nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen  
although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch  
the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around  
the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old  
there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before  
still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still  
this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price  
the cast for this film does an excellent job  
pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film  
he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience  
pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious  
this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role  
carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl  
she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time  
the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job  
the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen  
patrick renna , who played gugino's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him  
tiffani-amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , "" saved by the bell "" ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen  
she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television  
she wasn't given overly much to do in the film , but what she had , she does a good job with "
1,"this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley )  
others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work  
and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line  
receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy , "" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her  
he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses  
his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science  
that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming  
he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins  
the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , "" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "" 
she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored  
geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life  
while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area  
in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything  
the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle  
it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies  
that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point  
the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters  
geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty  
alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment  
geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him  
the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely  
the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies  
the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city  
the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way  
what is progress ? 
what can one expect out of life ? 
is the small farmer about to become extinct ? 
the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way  
that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white  
no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic  
there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically  
that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference  
the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high  
perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene "

1,"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story  
it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film  
but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy  
driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago  
the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union  
uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza  
the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur  
the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action  
in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together  
rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on  
the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr  martin luther king , jr  
the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway  
the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur  
freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke  
the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger  
driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon  
daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur  
initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere  
once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver  
to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand  
eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him  
tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace  
we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon  
nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own  
freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances  
there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color  
hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior  
both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma  
they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves "

[expectations - medium] 
long review =========== 
i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film  
i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be "" fluff  "" 
however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending  
 ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad  ) 
story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in  
alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very "" parodyish  "" 
 ( okay , bad term  ) 
extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle  
acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important  
however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more "" canadian "" type of mode  ) 
carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne  
tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted  
lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about  
without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way  
direction : spheeris is a classic "" music "" movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years  
 ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least  ) 
she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc  one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy  
overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl's skits to go see this film in the theatres  
however , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video  
you definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film  
without a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year  
it'll make tons 'o' dough for everyone involved  
let's just hope they make a thousand sequels

1,"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality  
but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations  
it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation  
in addition , it's also a terrific family film  
this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools  
it could also be described as `mrs  
streep's opus'  
yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad  
out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view  
she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? 
slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied  
one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven  
after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama  
at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material  
it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr  
holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth  
the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate  
yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work  
angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience  
blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest  
gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force  
it's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner  
the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin  
there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman  
in it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth  
it's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision  
it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal  
watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? 
of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? 
mission accomplished , wes  
thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film  
in it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile  
the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme "

1,"city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental  
i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality  
city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years  
it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this  
city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire  
i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two  
i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material  
nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it )  
one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr  maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her  
the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch )  
he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status  
seth wants to become human so he can feel her  
that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race  "" 
 ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death  ) 
messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human  
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel  
this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead  
since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect  
although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre  
the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them )  
the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable  
these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels  
the acting is superb from everyone involved  
this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock )  
he's quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words  
he's perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off )  
meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best  
dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel  
what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation "

1,"based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal  
now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all  
his latest challenge is his biggest though    he 
must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires  
admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some  
judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film  
to some degree , i agree with this sentiment  
having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade  
 ( "" men in black "" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) 
why is this ? 
for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand 
the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match  
the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided  
the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect  
superman 
is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this  
blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere  
this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show  
batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready )  
which brings me back to blade  
although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon  
the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that 
uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends  
the end results are not pretty by any means  
the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story  
screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films  
this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright  
this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires  
add this 
to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an "" anti-theft device "" ) , and one has an interesting premise  
however , the film works best as an action film  
actor wesley snipes has 
an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move  
proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a 
good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes  
regardless , this film is far from perfect "
1,"catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up  
she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life  
as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties  
a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls  
just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia  
the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  
in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    
a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! 
initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  
while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  
the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  's "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory  
despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  
all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  
the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  
if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film )  
the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed )  
in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i  e  - 
the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  
the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  
detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both  
besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling  
a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  
one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device "

1,"labelling is sometimes everything  
in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own  
walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors  
producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones  
on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america  
to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago  
instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city  
the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx  
that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce  
on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city  
crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus  
police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs  
the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs  
upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status  
however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year  
the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly  
if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably  
the future was much worse than his vision  
the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities  
their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime  
in their vocabulary , word "" arms "" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns  
they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own  
many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors  
some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour  
despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film  
the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes  
the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie  
editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory  
the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable  
yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity "
1,"the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films  
one was _gattaca_  
the other was _the thirteenth floor_  
just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_  
however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_  
a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered  
his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery  
along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture  
_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise  
the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view  
first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline  
second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel  
no wonder it fell through the cracks  
done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels  
many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment  
i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie  
despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller  
in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever  
the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging  
in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one  
although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw  
in fact , hannon fuller's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters  
this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil  
the tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves  
the major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well  
bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding  
d'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance  
the lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job  
her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times  
this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script "

1,"titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year  
and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the "" big summer releases "" were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
it's my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said "" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to  "" 
truer words are hard to come by  
of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc  still care to disagree ? 
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
it's obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant  
they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal  
meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game  
they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving  
for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life  
for rose , she is sailing to her doom  
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love  
it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches  
but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said  
it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories  
of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen "

1,"in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn't everything  "" 
i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film  
see , spoofs are easy with me  
i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love  
sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing  
sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter )  
sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film  
abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me  
it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything  
there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness  
i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking  
most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense  
mafia ! 
has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh  
the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino  
our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire  
to describe the story of mafia ! 
is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout  
along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing  
movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction  
abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! 
to his experience  
he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops )  
the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film  
mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here  
he looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool )  
he's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material  
lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone  
the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific  
unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! 
that i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh  
but that's a good sign : mafia ! 
is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory  
i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain  
i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain "

1,"whew  this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days  
like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control  
the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message  
the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle )  
bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate  
not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus  
you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name  
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message  
one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly  
it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot  
distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view  
you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens  
this film camera is just another one of the guys  
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across  
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares  
i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be  
that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted  
if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film  
stay at home and rent up close and personal  
and what's a buzz without tunes  
from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film  
good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message  
every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict

1," "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him  "" 
starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood  
rated r  
double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable  
it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  
there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops  
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  
not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake  
we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4  they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep  
libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  
she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up  
at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  
her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling  
her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  
once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend  
her friend gives her son the phone  
nick walks in the room  
little matty screams "" daddy ! "" 
the phone goes dead  
libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead  
she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her  
after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole  
she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones )  
she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated  
she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's "" adopter ""  
double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false  
the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances  
it's not like it matters  
this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious  
it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question "
1,"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j  fox )  
george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane )  
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat )  
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi )  
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak )  
it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m  night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  66 : 1

1," "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 
okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  
it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  
much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts  
all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend  
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends  
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight )  
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  
i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  
just fill in the blanks ! 
can you see it ? 
 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  
we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues     have 
we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 
well , there we go ! "" 
of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through  
together with her father dr  porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa  
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene  
thankfully , those aren't the exact words  
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction  
how does he tell his name to another ape ? 
 "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" 
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable  
but hey , tarzan's a young adult  
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 
isn't that illegal in most countries ? 
oh , well "
1," "" seven "" is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen  
it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun  
it's a serial killer mystery , but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer  
the story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery  
someone is murdering people who are offenders of "" the seven deadly sins  "" 
a fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions    
i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much  
what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the "" good guys "" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile  
brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie  
however , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn't get killed by the end )  
there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief  
this is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment  
the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be  
the production design is superb , in the spirit of "" batman "" and "" the crow , "" this film embodies the gothic mood  
the way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! 
the killer's victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case  
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense  
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown  
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this  
the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect  
let's just say it seems a little too "" mystery movie , "" or too convenient in other words  
when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues  
this is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story  
if anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings  
i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising  
there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points  
what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is  
 "" seven "" is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man  
john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of "" scum "

1,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant  
in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc  ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised ? 
well , so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace ""  
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the

1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable  
the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it  
most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties  
 "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" 
a guest asks impatiently  
 "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war "

1,"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us  
president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days  "" 
one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown  
that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962  
now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history  
taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p  o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war  
as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems  
meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment  
suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat  
where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project  
there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen  
it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation  
the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner  
costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family  
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know  
kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more  
the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though  
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels  
the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia  
the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro  
the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact  
while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba  
this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action  
when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable  
the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane  
this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles  
the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players  
greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent  
instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options "
1,"gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit  
in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years  
without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated  
 "" the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond  
it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions  
the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other  
annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown  
some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father  
for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future  
her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that  
when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to  
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about  
at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole )  
soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home  
 "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches  
slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery  
at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's "" the talented mr  ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her  
blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had  
we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress  
blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year  
in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's "" boys don't cry , "" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie  
as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's "" the watcher "" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all  
for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given  
giovanni ribisi ( 2000's "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad  
in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's "" wonder boys "" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn  
her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes  
finally , kim dickens ( 2000's "" hollow man "" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda  
the other notable aspect of "" the gift "" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating  
thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread "
1,"swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults  
steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie  
and he knows a money making winner when he sees one  
the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster  
hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro  
a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife  
the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead  
however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro  
banderas motive ? 
to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie  
with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners  
banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease  
hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work  
as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way  
the audience does hate them , which can't be bad  
catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance  
the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones  
there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together  
the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly  
the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well  
the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding  
although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment  
however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed  
it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel  
screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script  
although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent  
there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together  
the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off  
this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines  
however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going  
in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades "

1,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages  
martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime  
unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies  
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime  
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s  
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film )  
the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york  
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands  
after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro )  
three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history  
wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business  
but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends  
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory  
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating  
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny  
after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens  
scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience  
with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era  
even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker  
first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue  
then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards  
this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation  
same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack  
nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s  
but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed  
however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people  
such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s  
fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese  
he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film "
1,"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen  
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse  
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet  
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa  
his films all seem to have one style , bleak  
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold  
little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver  
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid  
his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with  
cure is probably his classic  
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon  
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story  
pulse is kurosawa back on form  
taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software  
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment  
taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software  
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain  
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself  
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall  
taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus  
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide  
but they are not entirely dead  
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet  
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost  
if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow  
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist  
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk  "" 
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses  
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers "
1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever  
so it is about time he made another film  
and what a ride it is  
the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better  
overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty  
it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end  
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight  
unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false  
however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent  
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view  
nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman  
he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion  
for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services  
 "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises  
as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates  
seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company  
jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games  
 "" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold  
one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests  
even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company  
what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun  
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way  
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive "
1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information  
generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s  , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  
the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil  "" 
however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare  
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  
admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid  
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  
in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk  
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  
throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides "
1,"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen  
i finished mike figgis' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr  
alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude ""  
 "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore  
ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk  
his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor  
in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of  
he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid  
when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable  
after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says "" i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again  "" 
now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben  
there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye  
it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy  
now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with  
once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death  
one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since "" adventures in babysitting "" ) named sera  
she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her  
they are both very lonely , self-destructive people  
they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another  
and it isn't even a sexual relationship  
they don't even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film  
 "" leaving las vegas "" is not a film about plot  
with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn't too much of a story to it  
it is more a film about people and how they react to one another  
from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film  
the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter  
but don't go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into  
first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from "" leaving las vegas ""  
it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that's right )  
secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don't see it "

1,"after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story  
as the film warns us at the beginning , it's not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea  
the only thing missing is charlton heston  
instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren  ) 
we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up  
moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn't really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule  
he soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer  ) 
rameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task  
while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen  
gone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot  
but , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen  
jeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested  
he's included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested  
and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring  
it's a remarkable achievement  
also remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost 'slap dash' effort , to shame  
relying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed  
the film seems a little caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and 'moving' shots , but they _do_ look incredible  
the final 'plague' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed  
kudos to the animators  
the vocal talent is also very good  
val kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn't sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing  ) 
sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great , and steve martin and martin short are very good , but not in the film long enough  
finally , michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife  
kudos also goes to the voice of god , who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued  
sadly , he is uncredited , and i couldn't quite work out who the voice was  
 ( but e-mail if you do  ) 
the songs are good , ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number  
they don't disturb the movie , and while not particularly memorable , they are nice to listen to ( they're well sung aswell  ) 
the musical score is suitably epic , with some beautiful tunes "

1,"no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life  
but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is  
 "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is  
the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given )  
it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams  
in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world  
after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life  
taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself  
but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker  
another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher  
she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge )  
several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least    ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile  
because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on  
if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on    
the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world  
he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life  
part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible  
but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death  
the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now )  
 "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't  
there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem  
satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what "" jude "" is  
sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be  
the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it  
christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times "
1,"david lynch's "" blue velvet "" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town  
however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a "" strange world "" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers  
the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film  
they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances  
odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story  
thankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable  
since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next  
this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising  
 "" blue velvet "" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting  
lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling  
the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan )  
from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping  
the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing  
maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends  
through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots  
lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion  
instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times  
lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine  
however , for fans of odd difficult indies , "" blue velvet "" could be just what they are looking for  
it is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper's sadistic frank  
most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable  
kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality  
laura dern was consistently annoying  
but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in  
his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask  
frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon  
many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy  
just like his villain in "" speed "" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak  
this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away  
 "" blue velvet "" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again "
1,"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original  
one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one  
its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day  
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience  
one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time  
it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g  epstein , philip j  epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director  
however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film  
until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age  
the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story  
in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government  
thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas  
many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains )  
his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody ""  
however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas  
this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca  
one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe  
he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris  
the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail  
rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism  
the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status  
bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character  
another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime  
the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works  
for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made  
but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life  
the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads  
the supporting actors also did a marvellous job  
sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters "
1,"steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film  
spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries  
he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle  
for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , "" saving private ryan "" is flawless  
literally  
the plot is simple enough  
after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt  john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt  
james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle  
once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home  
accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational  
barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home  
the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary  
literally  
there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes  
spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection  
the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan  
there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences  
this is what coppola was looking for in "" apocalypse now "" , but couldn't create  
the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war  
the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary  
he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears  
hanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here  
however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece  
with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film  
the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs  ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it  
but that is forgivable  
what isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences  
the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men "
1,"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull )  
roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film  
i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it  
the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter  
the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) )  
one can almost sense the cold  
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better  
this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots  
the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true  
this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed  
in the plane three men find ? the american dream    
in a gym bag  ? 
affliction too was set in a snowy landscape  
it really seems very simple  
just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true  
but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes  
as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing  
but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish  
the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense  
i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger  
the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story  
the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book  
this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author  
the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense  
i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what

1,"hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest )  
it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters  
i mean , come on  
are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? 
hell no  
and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films  
and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either  
this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu  
i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays  
and that is exactly what this film is ; art  
i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers  
let me backtrack a minute  
when i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved  
with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown  
those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen  
you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore  
this is a thinking man's slasher flick  
the "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy  
he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder )  
upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's )  
the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck    not 
really a good sign  
he then discovers through some reading that the count is a "" nosferatu "" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans  
but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat  
will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? 
the character of orlock is , of course , dracula  
the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel  
just thought that was an interesting little side note   "

1,"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon  
here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life  
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution  
i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? 
as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior  
in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything  
but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison  
a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs  
in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining  
i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months  
it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker  
the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers  
just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead  
flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them  
he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance )  
flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position  
the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation  
created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen  
the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action  
this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc  ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative  
the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening )  
but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters  
flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story  
but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar  
all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory  
in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence  
in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it  
with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through  
it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience  
after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty "
1,"roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor  
however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed  
maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed )  
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking  
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    
it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting  
it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective  
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed  
many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on    
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  
we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though  
there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing  
it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners  
some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free    
but i still don't know exactly how he did it  
russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity  
for whatever reason his stardom never arrived    
but he should have it now  
from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , "" let's go see the new russell crowe movie "" "
1,"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r  so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself  
 "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades  
it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant  
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen  
regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be  
the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason  
it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex  
as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all  
but , that's the movie  
now back to the preview  
prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv )  
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing  
hmmmmm  
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone  "" 
hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day  
bravely , i pursued  
 "" i've seen that trailer , oh    
probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped    
 "" and i don't remember that scene  "" 
 "" well , "" she chirped  
 "" it's there

will tim turn chris in ? 
will chris turn tim in ? 
will they turn themselves in ? 
all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film  
the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun  
the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film  
this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs  
there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films  
the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying  
it is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen "
1,"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze  
i liked showgirls ( there , i said it )  
i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash  
wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen  
it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards  
criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic  
wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies  
i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal  
i imagine that this shows  
it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known  
i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here  
i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida  
in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges  
all of this happens fairly early in the film  
and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted  
i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked  
wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks  
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers  
i'd give the preview four stars  
it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since  
over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong  
the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets  
but i'm not here to talk about the preview  
i'm here to talk about denise richards  
now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can  
of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes    and 
flawless body "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body "
1," "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds  
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score  
dah-dum  
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip  
perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie  
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act  
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  
until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music  
he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying  
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery  
the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  
brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  
hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying  
when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark  
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it  
 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror  
it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" )  
even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age  
although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  
the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  
scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  
nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town  
 "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him  
dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  
however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  
bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism "

1,"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out  
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact  
 "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making  
it has altered the way films will be viewed  
 "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count  
sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s  
in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic )  
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay  
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already  
the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine  
the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's  
they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  
after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment ""  
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell ""  
i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win  
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge  
previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  
as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent  
he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence  
on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus  
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig ! "" 
scene from "" deliverance ""  
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l  jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car  
they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball  
they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out  
in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began  
if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition  
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen "
1,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable  
she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith  
one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom  
he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it  
god would do it him/herself , but he/she is    missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again  
bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far  
at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek )  
it's a wild ride  
they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return  
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  
at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  
it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? ""  
wings of desire this ain't  
since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors  
 ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden  ) 
his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another  
dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition  
as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever  
any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack  
a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough  
because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time  
sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated  
like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker  
dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! 
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished

rated : r ( ! ) for sexual content , crude and sexual humor , and some nudity   
 ( a mild r rating ) 
starring : rob schneider , oded fehr , eddie griffin , arija bareikis , amy poehler , norm mcdonald  
running time : 88 minutes 
 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving  
it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too  
it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute  
deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it  
though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get  
he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip  
trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets  
the thing is now he has to try and find $6 , 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again  
so he decides to go "" man-whoring "" and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth : an over-weight woman who decidedly wants to eat everything in site , a woman with narcolepsy who sleeps all the time , a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts , and a woman he can't stop thinking about  
he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate  
from now on he is considered deuce bigalow : male gigolo  
with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is sometimes like last years hit "" there's something about mary "" that is offensive but very funny  
the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart , clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny  
the characters in the film are all actually likable especially "" jabba lady "" with her big body but soft heart  
there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me  
even though i thought "" toy story 2 "" and "" being john malkovich "" were the funniest of the year "" deuce bigalow "" follows right behind them  
the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film  
rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate ( arija bareikis ) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it  
 "" deuce bigalow "" is a good-natured film worth all the merit it can get  
its not a classic or a masterpiece , it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching  
sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes , but you cannot deny that it isn't funny  
 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is no disappointment  
its a fast paced , entertaining sweet and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic  
fans of schneider will not be disappointed and fans of crude but nice comedies will not either  
for some reason the film garnered an r rating but with no "" f words "" or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r  a mild r to put it to the least , but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see "
1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging  
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil  
it's just sad  "" 
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears  
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house  
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills  
she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down  
 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts  
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 
worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone  
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it  
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  
of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film  
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  
thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely  
 "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable  
the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  
sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey  
it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today "
1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen  
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it  
it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world  
it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and    well , it's just an _experience_  
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation    and 
it's about to do so again  
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now  
interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm    all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www  islandnet  com/~corona/films/details/sw4  html

1,"he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother  
she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus  
he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases  
he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door  
he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit  
he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc  , etc  then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears  
his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion  
unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out  
he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts  
soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest  
bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable  
the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom  
bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind  
so far , so good  
the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant  
the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe  
it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins  
it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes  
he observes what it might be like  
the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack  
for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own  
then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers  
our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives  
he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson )  
  
  
it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once  
de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again "
1," "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made  
it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout  
this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly  
harrison ford stars as dr  richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife  
the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner  
we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective  
hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered  
we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story  
in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves  
the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story  
one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck  
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch  
this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable  
tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u  s  marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives  
from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur  
kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other  
most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife  
ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is  
just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting  
we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we  
meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down  
at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them  
he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery  
one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor  
there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck )  
they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner  
the final act concludes with another terrific chase "
1,"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people  
in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy  
in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer  
even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love  
in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character  
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up  
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  
booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident  
the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg  
annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker  
at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work  
instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest )  
in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically  
the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs  country  
in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor  
the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people  
redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago  
in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains  
but then , that would ruin the magic  
much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land  
to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1  85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2  35 : 1 aspect ratio  
in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" )  
although "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story  
it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is  
in "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill  
he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him  
he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man "

1,"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france  
when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix  "" 
writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre  
their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself  
felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends  
when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away  
felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot  
he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny  
along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations  
on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police  
following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family  
his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix  
they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on  
he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to  
she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father  
in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles  
he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister  "" 
he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would  
on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son  
 "" the adventures of felix "" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery  
first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix  
he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of "" cocktails , "" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself  
as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally  
bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen  
the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way  
patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix  
ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had  
only the "" cousin "" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's "" family  "" 
 "" the adventures of felix "" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning  
it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside "

1,"there was a lot riding on this movie  
everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end  
what would be the "" final act "" ? 
this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves  
no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co  
so , how does the story go ? 
as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems  
she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone  
but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off  
instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him  
the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two  
not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette )  
at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional  
nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene  
so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing  
sometimes both  
clever , indeed  
but , who goes next ? 
no one knows  
three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the "" scream "" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read  
still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly  
when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through "" woodsboro , "" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of "" scream 3 "" ? ? ? s finest moments  
okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the "" scream "" fan  
no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said "" dramatic element "" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with "" scream ""  
throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films  
granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore  
honestly , i like this approach  
it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven  
he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience  
some critics have noted that "" scream 3 "" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s  
what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer  
it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying  
all in all , "" scream 3 "" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) "
1,"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen  
in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven  
his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of  
that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage  
the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far    
with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator  
luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie  
talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career  
his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona  
he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey  
he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however  
ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show  
quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer  
unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! 
also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia  
she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her  
the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy  
the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film  
peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun  
the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card  
although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll  
sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam  
also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing  
the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim  
while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do  
also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show  
overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment  
certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone  
it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed "
1,"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction  
since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn  
in between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances  
now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown  
and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed  
for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie  
the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses  
and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet  
yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown  
the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent  
the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives  
and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around  
there's a samuel l  jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it  
jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives  
this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire  
however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional  
had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost  
as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity  
for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon  
this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown )  
in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits  
there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking )  
grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states  
she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official  
no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's "" banyon "" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal  
jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds  
soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro )  
unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l "

1,"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men  
blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it  
it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well  
although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie  
the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story  
but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once  
that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit  
blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire  
his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire  
including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust  
blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother  
but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films  
the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires  
where do vampires get money ? 
well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations  
i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie  
blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community  
he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority  
he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable  
it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire  
admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through  
the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less  
the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type  
this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this  
the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise  
it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise  
blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster  
the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done  
although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences  
blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre  
this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle "

1,"after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? 
what made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? 
was it the tunes from sinatra , etc  , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? 
was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? 
the charisma of the two leads ? 
even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances  
i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such  
which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider  
it was traditional , magical  
we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in  
it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings  
the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction  
from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the "" return to me "" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet  
the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy  
real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice  
we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence  
the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal  
everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film  
>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes  
from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints  
from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part  
 "" return to me "" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist  
we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father  
whatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors  
disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written  
duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder  
instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of "" the x-files  "" 
duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen  
minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer  
though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses  
while "" return to me "" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop  
the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart  
we already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point  
as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless "

1,"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds  
this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper  
from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale  
although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye  
while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community  
the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world  
the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way  
their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone  
shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey  
courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself  
whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment  
but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage  
he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them  
secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor  
throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona  
an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona  
children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist  
after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance  
surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night  
in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self  
upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred  
any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance  
on the technical side , shrek triumphs  
directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters  
these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona )  
myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings  
murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen  
cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack  
while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s  h "

boy likes girl  
girl likes boy  
boy and girl begin dating  
parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy  
girl steps to boy's defense  
family problems occur  
girl learns more about the boy  
boy goes nuts  
fun ensues  
critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? 
well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you  
it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes )  
i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7  5/10 )  
he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards )  
the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots    if 
you're into that kind of thing , that is : )  
i didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie  
then again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the "" big deal "" was about his daughter dating david  
his reply : "" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter  "" 
good point  
all in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare  
mind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on  
and on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all    it was a flaming success ! !

1,"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed    all while still alive  
recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy  
problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice    
walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good  
the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all  
they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi  
the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed )  
unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres  
on one hand , it is a fast paced action film  
on the other , it's a frightening horror film  
and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy  
ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson )  
the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner  
if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible  
and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies  
while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy  
replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness  
while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place  
but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of  
on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience  
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners    turn 
the sound down ! 
while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful )

this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was  
she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was  
finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not  
to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson  
jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time  
rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping  
thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy    
this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia  
the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly  
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story  
it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating  
this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough  
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective  
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency  
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable  
the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie  
part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast  
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  
the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles  
looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie  
the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is  
one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself  
yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character  
how is the titanic a character ? 
you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you  
this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this  
mr  cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense "
1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise  
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order  
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force  
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut  
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy  
the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard )  
they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute  
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge  
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause  
current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free  
at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage  
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to  
he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up  
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies "
1,"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series  
i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it  
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well  
for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things  
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b  c  
two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside  
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien  
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze  
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail  
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas  
on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right  
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse  
five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head  
the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made  
their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth  "" 
the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired  
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me  
it didn't  
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them  
but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden  
it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high  
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring  
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it  
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest  
before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth  
the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either  
there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america  ) 
make this fantastic film feel more real  
ward russell's cinematography is very good "

1,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented )  
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise  
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  
there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there  
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict  
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist  
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely  
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right  
the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling  
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone  
the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him  
in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc  until after we've observed them for a while  
but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story  
eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police  
we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time  
two other important characters are also introduced : dr  daniel p  schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies  
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film  
he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story  
but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo  
everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities  
however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential  
by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax  
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction  
but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off  ' 
for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' )  
the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight  
at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then "

it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so , it's up to the u  s  government to stop it  
 ( why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated  ) 
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within

his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a  j "
1,"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 
right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song  
the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field  
it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio  
a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films  
their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo  "" 
in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people  
ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department  
but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1  2 million  
their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money  
there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens  
the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow  
some of the interludes are an epiphany , though  
the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root )  
they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow  "" 
it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year  
contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother  "" 
in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched  
the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz  "" 
they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" 
and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here  
the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels  
george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today  
he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity  
ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets  
his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer  
while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar  
the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism  
delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine  
the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst  
all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones "

1,"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it  
probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's  
however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made  
corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  
her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion  
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  
they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  
lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  
this is not clear to lucas , however  
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen  
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  
they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie  
surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school  
the next scene is brilliant  
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  
he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion  
in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters  
but maggie is written smarter than that  
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him  
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen )  
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend  
what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks  
of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next  
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship  
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone  
she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt  
maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body  
this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires "

1," "" the celebration "" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant  
you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs  
i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like  
i don't really feel there are to be any real "" rules "" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work  
but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences  
when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me  
 "" the celebration "" is great because it's chock full of those  
it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life  
and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up  
the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him  
all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here )  
the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home  
his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable  
we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to  
once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age  
but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch  
twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends  
the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion  
as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose "" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability "" so that they may "" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot  "" 
i have not seen "" breaking the waves , "" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but "" the celebration "" works exquisitely in this department  
it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video  
as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to  
we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film  
the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth  
throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water  
of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them  
and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier  
but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface  
the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex  
everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics

1,"jacques tati's 1953 classic "" les vacances de m  hulot "" ( also known as "" mr  hulot's vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film  
the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation  
yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory  
part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags  
slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going  
in "" les vacances de m  hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key  
in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat  
while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it  
when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues  
tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film  
it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and "" les vacances de m  hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well  
tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement  
when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark  
tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he's not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does  
for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one  
then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce  
the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy  
as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did  
the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters  
it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons  
instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem

what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america  
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom  
unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada  
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon  
on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson )  
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle  
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang  
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out  
chon demands to know where carson city is  
roy directs him , and chon leaves  
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself  
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy  
 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun  
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable "
1,"i was pleasantly surprised by this film  
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school  
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie  
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen  
titanic tells its story in two time periods  
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news  
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  
there she tells her story to lovett and his team  
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york  
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word  
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping  
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through  
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  
girls are going to swoon over him  
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing  
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante  
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting  
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him  
his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate  
he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model  
like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well  
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century )  
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match  
additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie  
nice to see dr "
1,"the seasoned capt  dudley smith ( james cromwell ) questions his new protege , ed exley ( guy pearce ) about his political views when it comes to police work  
 "" would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty ? 
would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved ? "" 
exley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed 'no  ' 
stunned , smith pleads , "" then , for the love of god , don't be a detective  "" 
la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s  
organized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done  
there was "" hollywood "" jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito )  
sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn't afraid to flash his tinseltown style  
detective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice  
and then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive  
a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication  
almost immediately , an arrest is made  
but something doesn't seem quite right  
new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department  
suspicion and questions begin to mount  
odd alliances are created  
and as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment  
when the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn )  
all of the characters' levels of involvement are not immediately clear  
we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case  
we sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us , the audience , closer to the truth  
we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery  
absorbing and affecting , this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir  
it boasts mysterious figures in control , double-crosses , hard information from sleazy sources , dirty politicians , corrupt cops , haunting women , and hard-nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity  
the underlying mystery is compelling  
the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous  
the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch ( i wouldn't be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance )  
and , the dialogue is rich and memorable  
the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do

1,"veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort  
when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs  
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake  
he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora )  
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session  
the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk  
eastwood furrows his brow  
as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent  
he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand  
but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? 
jeter doesn't know what he's talking about  
eastwood furrows his brow  
crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime  
the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs  
isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments  
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him  
denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife )  
but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera  
playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines  
when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive  
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes  
true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star  
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow )

1,"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does  
far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 
thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception  
i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge  
unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight )  
off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney )  
while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup  "" 
he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 
as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human  "" 
the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable  
there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor  
pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it  
the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development  
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice  
it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim  
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent  
several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work  
 "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie  
woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like  
the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner "
1,"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway  
in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where  
he's mean  
i mean really mean  
the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium  
every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress  
you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe  
one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks  
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too  
another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor  
aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target  
simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , also gay , does not fare much better  
when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces  
this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage  
an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him  
it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love  
one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others  
he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows  
good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt  
they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen  
greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon  
he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels  
cuba gooding jr  performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance  
the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l  brooks , is clever , touching , and funny  
the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting  
melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention  
carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem "

1,"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 
that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow  
she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder  
the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win  
jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history  
he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber  
his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980  
the background to the case is such  
during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke  
the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will  
when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood  
claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail  
he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him  
ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him  
we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out  
dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case  
nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him  
together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed  
silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film  
schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz  
there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical  
yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well  
the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks  
the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending  
the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion  
the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters  
yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons  
as von bulow , he is brutally evil  
anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame  
irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence  
he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder "

austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery  
many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles  
he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr  evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth  
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr  evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space  
dr  evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents  
upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr  evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr  evil , which is later named mini me  
the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr  evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr  evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil  "" 
dr  evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one  
dr  evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner  
dr  evil loving ? 
wow ! 
mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr  evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body  
austin powers learns of dr  evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it  
once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr  evil  
as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr  evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! "" 
to the president of the united states  
many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you

1,"well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise  
not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995  
once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer  
the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns  
it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent  
the plot in brief  
paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons  
his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans  
he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr  rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf  
he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires  
but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric  
i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging  
british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 )  
but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding  
the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character  
york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic  
this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him  
and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths  
the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original  
the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988  
the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h  winkless  
and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock  
in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end  
tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation  
but these are minor complaints  
just see it  
not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years  
and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude "

mark wahlberg stars as capt  leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future  
he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery  
despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious  
some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed  
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter  
the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says  
you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement  
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand  
lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human  "" 
anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue  
another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen  thade  
the young chimp goes to visit his dying father  
both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans  
with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring  
that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret  
the performances throughout are top-notch  
wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home  
he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet  
this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable  
roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity  
he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet "
1,"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances  
for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women )  
despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences  
the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england  
as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback  
meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest  
lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology  
lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor  
lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself  
yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin  
and fate has decreed that they will one day meet  
that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help  
another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory  
at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other  
a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent  
but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her  
oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions  
on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route  
coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere  
the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments  
 ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant  ) 
yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda  
storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters  
thematically , the film is also strong  
the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated  
oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls  
a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion  
oscar does not see gambling as a vice  
in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith  
ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar "
1,"one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise  
 "" spy kids "" certainly did  
an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun  
the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience  
the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving  
bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence  
what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics  
consider the other pg rated "" family friendly "" movie in theaters now  
 "" see spot run "" has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor  
body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop  
what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film  
the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process  
at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together  
of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells  
somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ? 
 "" spy kids "" is a welcome antidote to the repellent "" see spot run , "" using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness  
carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino )  
mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children  
what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies  
once agents from different countries assigned to "" erase "" each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family  
needless to say , they get drawn back to the business  
shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show  
but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children  
papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him  
back at home , "" uncle "" felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids  
after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them  
during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses  
they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show  
they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ? 
because they're all thumbs ! ) 
they move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from "" star trek  "" 
the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either "" mission : impossible "" movie  
director robert rodriguez ( "" from dusk to dawn "" ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes "

1,"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  
artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  
for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  
to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples  
a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children  
and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution  
a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love  
as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor )  
their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  
the first third of a  i  
deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin  
circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  
he is abandoned and alone  
david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him  
the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  
during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex  
spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  
here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  
the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange  
at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  
it is all very anti-climatic and jarring  
these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film

1," "" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! "" 
mrs  pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son  
 "" didn't i sound just like a mother ? "" 
 "" you are a mother , "" her son marty tells her disgustedly  
 "" i know , but i still can't believe it  
i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? "" 
marty , you see , is a grown-up twin  
although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  
mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko  
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  
the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being  
mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  
she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb  
the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  
the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  
in this storm are two sane individuals  
the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication  
as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr  plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night  
 "" we all have our secrets , "" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few  
this is a house filled with them  
 ( when lesly calls it the family's "" home "" to mrs  pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs  pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their "" house  "" ) 
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , "" made for each other , "" the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship  
they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it  
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches  
jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his  
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands  
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy "

1,"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic  
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview  
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess     it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull  
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made  
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date  
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at  
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage  
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies  
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise  
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic  
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor  
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure  
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage  
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family  
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love  
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game  
the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins  
add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy  
i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship  
she is a pleasure to see on screen  
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters  
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on  
the effects are tremendous  
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other  
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen  
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard "
1,"men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way  
although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type  
the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets  
director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece  
the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be  
the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist  
the mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe ""  
a though job , indeed  
the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states  
presumably , these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers  
that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them  
agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien  
when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them  
the device , described as "" out of state "" , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on  
>from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith  
edwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal  
the criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground  
edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him  
edwards doesn't take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder  
back at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions  
he informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made  
he has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day  
edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he  
after goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do  
in the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter  
edgar ( vincent d'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport  
the "" bug "" , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors  
and it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war  
men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film  
the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer "
1," "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  
from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  
well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion  
instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  
and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments  
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  
when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene  
the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  
with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims  
the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work  
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier  
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  
with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  
duvall has every movement down pat  
even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  
he dances and claps all the way  
sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive  
 "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent  
and they lap it up  
people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" 
and mean it  
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable  
but sonny is no saint  
it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed  
sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever  
the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock  
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e  f "
1,"it was a crazy time in france , what with the french revolution right around the corner  
king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi  
such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais  
beaumarchais was the author of the plays , "" the barber of seville "" and "" the marriage of figaro  "" 
today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once  
the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture  
one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year  
now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story  
the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais  
with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience  
his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning  
in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy  
as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship  
into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight  
beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided  
that over with , the fight is on  
with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him  
audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney  
although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style  
michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets  
jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies  
director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes  
the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style  
typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath  
one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man  
another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution  
all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but  
the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts  
the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life  
but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him "

1,"corey yuen's latest film , "" hero "" is notable on two fronts  
first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production  
secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao  
the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai  
poverty and crime rule most of china  
a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier  
tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army  
wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation  
their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love  
wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction  
after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her  
first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous  
unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club  
the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn  
jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home  
see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder  
see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing  
unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung  
the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow  
the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's "" eastern condors "" , is a marvelous surprise  
his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious  
the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance  
his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride  
his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence  
but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better  
corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late  
the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch  
the action scenes do not disappoint either  
this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike'  
the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible "
1,"of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable  
think about it  
frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting  
if you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j  fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly  
movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt  
there's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something  
 ( and there's that michael j  fox thing again  ) 
but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about  
you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn )  
you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer )  
were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires  
any day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record  
or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade  
wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path  
in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses  
snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u  s  marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers  
blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse  
he is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets  
yet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent  
like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action  
for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver  
 ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires  ) 
unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles  
the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance  
blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance  
with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment "
1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours  
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  
  
  
eighteen hours worth of static )  
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet  
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble "
1,"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me  
because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  
as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something  
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  
for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  
or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  
again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  
i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking  
but he simply uses the best tool for the job  
it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward  
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet  
the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom  "" 
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story  
 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated  ) 
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items  
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own  
the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama  
scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk  
before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation  
sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice  
either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader  
>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation  
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child

1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds )  
after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is  
in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do  "" 
the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading  
it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but     "" 
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  
there's always the big but  
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  
 "" a great experiment "" , he calls it  
brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother  
there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel  "" 
she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious  
in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over "

1,"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman  
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips  
as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes  
instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city  
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity  
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment  
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds  
arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas  
his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives  
in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii )  
it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark  
arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body  
she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine  
veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process  
she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture  
arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation  
arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns  
joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house  
arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! 
he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations  
the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity  
like wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences  
every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way  
the movie also offers a provocative look at technology  
wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job  
the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers  
wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions  
was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? 
is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? 
the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw  
according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution  
ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking  
wang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d "
1,"you've heard all the hype  
you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker  
if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy  
you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults  
believe the hype  
the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth  
but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy  
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well  
amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life )  
and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman  
however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost  
for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back  "" 
so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful  
a lot of the movie is like that  
r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them    
because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way  
same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  
even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  
what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  
there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be "

1,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes  
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first  
 "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness  
hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer  
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen  
then comes the setup  
donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients  
to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines  
gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six  "" 
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n  m  , containing $2 million in cash  
there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead  
the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money  
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers  
decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby  
she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life  
thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature  
owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr  ) is currently the most hated man in america  
an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game  
after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention  
mr  pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america  
he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times  
pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation  
randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas  
fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview

1,"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't  
the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film  
we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  
but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  
they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman  
the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her  
the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic  
in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america  
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich  
she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them  
oh yeah , and the ship sinks  
and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius  
the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak  
the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film  
without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  
firstly , there's cameron's direction  
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic  
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end  
there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron  
it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below  
thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes  
to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters  
dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old  
his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines  
winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth  
zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash  
the audience really does come to hate him  
he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well  
also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american  
finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects "

but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain cole's trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone

about his "" secrets  "" 
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  
bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees

1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back  
however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible  
one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen )  
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn )  
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo "
1,"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs  miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 )  
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie  
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  
there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom  
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity  
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes  
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds  
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman )  
a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it  
whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been "" screwing around  "" 
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses  
he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together  
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers  
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that  
as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack  "" 
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency  
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr  ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger )  
dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out  
from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action  
altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look  
if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining  
gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light  
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability  
in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world  
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies  
but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings  
 "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here "

1,"i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie  
i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night  
it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether )  
i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now  
and i love gillian anderson  
the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off  
the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying  
this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment )  
i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met  
actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right  
when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work  
the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building  
but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself  
the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien  
the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer  
it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi  
soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens  
as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise  
fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film  
director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television  
there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema )  
the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic  
what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story  
our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film  
there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises  
it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly  
the series is strong for a lot of reasons  
it's original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show  
what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors  
duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch "
1,"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys  
one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker  
woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy  
woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him  
buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend  
meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped  
al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll  
now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan  
the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody  
if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever  
trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered  
while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy  
the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i  e  , al's apartment building )  
the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear  
while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else  
buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  
in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life  
most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be  
 "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie  
woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic  
this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends  
the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp  
on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten  
the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt  
after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals  
of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it's also very funny  
most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building "
1,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is  
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act  
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic )  
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky  
she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try  
they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming  
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  
here , the setup is a little different  
kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her  
she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear )  
she is also having an affair , of sorts  
you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152  
they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is  
ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman )  
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  
every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! ""  
it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness  
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  
hmm  well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness  
you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 
thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids "
1,"for this review and more , visit clear illusions ( www  clearillusions  com ) 
the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as "" i'll be right back , "" or simply with the overall tone of the scene  
how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change ? 
that's the kind of bursting originality that allows "" final destination "" to invade the viewer's mind , even days after seeing it , making one pause before ever entering a dark room , taking a shower , or even going to sleep  
the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's "" scream  "" 
 "" final destination , "" directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick , glen morgan , and james wong , the latter two being writers for the t  v  
series "" the x-files , "" is a movie with wonderful ideas , and executes them effortlessly  
it's rare a film of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days , as the genre has seem to be completely worn out ? ? `but "" final destination "" has more in store for one than one can imagine  
unlike "" halloween "" 's michael myers or "" nightmare on elm street "" 's freddy kruger , "" final destination "" 's killer is of the supernatural , the dark one himself , death  
the intriguing premise is as follows ; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip  
after boarding the plane , one of the students , alex browning ( devon sawa ) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff , killing everyone on board  
once waking up , alex gets himself and six others off of that plane , all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening  
shortly after their departure , the plane takes off , and guess what ; it blows up in middair  
now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms  valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them  
the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane ? ? `but who is next , and how will death get them ? 
 "" final destination "" is a film that is unbearably suspenseful ; always making the viewer frantic , as death will strike in the most unlikely of times  
john denver's "" rocky mountain high "" being played pretty much warrants another death ? ? `everyone on that plane learned the hard way  
although it's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you don't know when death is coming  
like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during "" final destination ""  
the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air ? ? ` and yes , the film is that intense  
the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par ; the best ensemble in this genre since "" scream  "" 
the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way  
devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film , and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances , that , like the "" scream "" movies did for their cast , will launch them into superstardom  
kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive , although the two don't posses as much screen time as the leads  
 "" final destination "" is one exhilarating , exciting ride  
any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film , and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack  
for the blood loving moviegoer , "" destination "" contains buckets of blood , guts , and all that good stuff  
 "" final destination "" is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans , and a sleeper hit at the box office  
hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me "
1,"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways  
in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others  
this movie closely resembles a james bond flick  
it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal  
kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations  
the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests  
as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork  
that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint  
he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be  
this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life  
kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija  
during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles  
once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid  
when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire  
dr  emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion  
this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death  
the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people  
this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal  
tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue  
one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions  
they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us  
kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula  
when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist  
yet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside  
shue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do  
when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak  
the saint is very action-packed , with few slow points  
the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments  
along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy "
1,"seen at the 21st portland international film festival 
film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film    
funny and pointed in its own way  
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you     
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through  
having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers  
and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer  
goro has a supermarket  
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket  
bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can  
goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else  
hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market  
and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves  
hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all  
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference  
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store  
a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things  
as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors  
eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown  
and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent  
in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined  
with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested  
but this would take away from the satire and its strengths  
with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it  
and what fun it is  
worth seeing "

1,"after the press screening of "" moulin rouge , "" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues  
everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images  
a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it  
another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye  
when one fellow quietly stated "" i've never really been a fan of musicals , "" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical  
there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it  
 "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience  
australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind "" strictly ballroom "" and "" romeo + juliet , "" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from "" the sound of music "" to "" smells like teen spirit  "" 
sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , "" moulin rogue "" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the "" random "" setting  
oh , and it has a story as well  
 "" it was 1899 , the summer of love    
 "" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , "" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , "" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo )  
christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor  
at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying  
christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession  
working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named "" spectacular spectacular  "" 
zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine  
as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land  
like a teeter-totter , "" moulin rogue "" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime  
one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales  
together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky  
other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload  
the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like "" bewitched "" beat into the ground  
of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind  
 "" we never heard from baz to turn it down , "" one of the actors told the los angeles times  
 "" it was always , 'more ! 
more ! ' "" 
the director even sent a note to his cast reading , "" i dare you to make me say you've gone too far  "" 
the musical numbers reflect his attitude  
one knockout piece , the "" elephant love medley , "" incorporates the beatles' "" all you need is love , "" u2's "" in the name of love , "" dolly parton's "" i will always love you "" and elton john and bernie taupin's "" your song "
1,"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well  
taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us  
but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted  
so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment  
like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man  
the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different  
al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle  
and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie  
will is a troubled individual  
as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse  
an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis  
now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet  
he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box  
but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems  
while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards  
then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work  
will flees , but lambeau tracks him down  
unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer  
the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist  
eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case  
after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor  
and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver )  
the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation  
the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles  
at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a "" taster's choice moment  "" 
later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith  
 ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene  ) 
director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes  
there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric  
likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship "

when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st  petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate  
with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods  
smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin  
in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter  
he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can  
soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce  
when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st  petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana  
this time , onegin finds her irresistable  
what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch  
overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past  
the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like "" onegin ""  
petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "" parking lot "" : "" you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone  "" 
onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well  
what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go  
out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard  
tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital  
she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties  
tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares  
they both have faces , mr  fiennes and ms  tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery  
_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of "" masterpiece theater "" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm  
an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair  
the film has an atypical period look , as well  
absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time "
1,"it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time  
based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue  
however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction  
frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks )  
through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law  
from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners  
the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them  
the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb  
the ensemble acting in the film is perfect  
hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles  
they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles  
they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience  
the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting  
some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan  
hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie  
every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying  
it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks  
rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection  
as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others  
this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable  
the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill  
duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men  
his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause  
his pain creates pain for the viewer  
however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film  
the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show  "" 
the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks  
not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief  
as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction  
his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing "
1,"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something  
it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up  
it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film  
having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about  
does men live up to its press ? 
well , yes it does  
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office  
for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment  
chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business  
chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder  
howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent  
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge  
there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her  
the reason ? 
both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex  
 "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says  
howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan  
they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp  
chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner  
howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate  
flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both  
you can guess which one she falls for  
soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him  
adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? 
in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls  
his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile  
we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart  
his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him  
he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness  
if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind  
politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground  
men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory  
the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe "

1,"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage  
 ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan  ) 
in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china  
a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle  
mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father  
ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph  
the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes  
mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman  
the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy )  
in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army  
old mr  fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen )  
fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead  
meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner  
 ( his only duty is to ring a gong  ) 
mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero  
with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? 
opinion : east meets west  
i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors  
from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan  
i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? 
yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic  
the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever  
personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative  
mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney  
kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing  
and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles  
and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning  
but even the tiniest details reveal quality  
the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place  
computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback  
and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game "
1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching  
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces  
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all ""  
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way  
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him  
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers "

1,"ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition 
synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? 
believe it  
sliding doors is a love 'what if' story  
the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions  
in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job  
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch )  
helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future  
the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories  
in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train  
arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn )  
this leads to a life where helen moves out  
helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business  
in story two , helen experiences a different fate  
she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity  
in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry  
will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? 
opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks  
at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking  
sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year  
not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance  
when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about ! 
nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes  
nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "" 
when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache  
and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob )  
instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk  
another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation  
in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local  
there are minor inconveniences  
since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two  
distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles  
but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing  
also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc  ) are spoken by the british characters "
1,"apocalypse now , based on the novel "" hearts of darkness "" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle  
a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film  
in many ways , this debate could go either way  
apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made  
in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years  
apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l  willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e  kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia  
captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with "" extreme prejudice "" because he has been deemed a murderer  
willard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation  
accusing someone of murder in this situation is like "" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 "" , as he puts it  
it doesn't make too much sense  
escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat  
the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr  clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne )  
willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big  
the men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations  
but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore  
kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf  
surf  
this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson  
duvall's portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes  
eventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz's frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers  
one of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard  
but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony  
kurtz is actually well aware of willard's mission , and refers to him as "" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill ""  
yet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does  
apocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war  
a movie that will hypnotize you with it's brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war  
definitely on the "" do not miss "" list "

1,"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x  i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  
i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  
as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton  
it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star  
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year  
he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien )  
the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car  
we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny  
in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother  
much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy  
when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things  
what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms  
it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material  
because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic  
i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart  
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men  
it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up  
of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part  
it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest  
in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease  
even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead  
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny  
the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien  
visually , the film is very powerful  
kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere  
but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes  
although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed  
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way  
it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film "
1,"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon  
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer  
simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them  
simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart  
surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle  
simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what  
joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is  
simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't "" natural ""  
even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a "" normal "" son  
he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev  russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks  
the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother  
it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie  
joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is  
with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way  
most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is  
simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way  
starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey  
jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right  
this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job  
simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series  
he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly  
the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat  
the cast is excellent  
joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance  
joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15  
ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation  
other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast  
i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year  
take your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece "

1,"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today  
1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year  
we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them  
this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films  
critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment  
but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie  
the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend  
her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted  
after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck  
of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her  
however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money  
she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years  
while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there  
she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again  
which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it  
after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones  
he is a man who has had his share of bad things  
while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not  
whatever happens the film was excellent to me  
i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great  
ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie  
even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how  
this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen  
it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way  
the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made  
it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances  
the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years  
even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it  
the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie  
i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability "
1,"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  
i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs  
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island  
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w  
earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks  
it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital  
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day  
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love  
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  
there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them  
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work  
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  
one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment  
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller  
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation  
ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out  
it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top  
actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties  
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money  
in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler  
it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93  
like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation  
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times "

1,"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility  
considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally , we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film  
but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? 
the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ? 
yes  
does it matter ? 
not really  
the film opens in october of 1969  
firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson )  
the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it  
when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other  
sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  
now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point  
when "" frequency "" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing  
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving  
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  
i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  
it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  
 ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself  ) 
i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  
some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film "

1,"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style  
the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force  
1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc  ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike  
to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city  
on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one  
 ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m  p  a  a  ) 
after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s  c  i  
recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program  
using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal  
the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s  c  i  
engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think )  
with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s  c  i  
envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems  
the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers  
as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective  
dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects  
several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics  
because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater  
although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre  
rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society "

1,"everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene  
everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over  
and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance  
good ! 
that's what you're supposed to do ! 
oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning  
deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 )  
major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry  
when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences  
it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating )  
but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e  g  
pulp fiction )  
pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny  
but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter  
the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory  
the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others  
joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox )  
the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip  
they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40  00 for the task  
drew also has the famous "" dueling banjos "" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged  
the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way  
everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone  
they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them  
ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men  
ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back  
the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body  
disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film  
while attempting to make a quick "" paddle for it "" , both canoes tip over  
drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found  
lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition "

1," "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  
the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy )  
unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in  
veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider  
after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  
however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife  
she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied  
at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself  
once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well  
she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco  
their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances  
in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love  
 "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her  
 "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  
it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing  
much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role  
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady  
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes  
the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood  
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas  
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy "
1,"like the wonderful 1990 drama , "" awakenings , "" starring robin williams and robert de niro , "" at first sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , "" directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks  
since "" awakenings "" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , "" at first sight "" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama  
the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country  
at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind  
amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love  
once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history  
at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis )  
ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects  
he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship  
on the basis of the overall story , "" at first sight "" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , "" awakenings  "" 
what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance  
however , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy  
usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you've got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight  
the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil  
the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two  
these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the "" big city  "" 
the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board  
val kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears  
it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off  
mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here  
although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's "" mimic , "" 1998's "" the replacement killers "" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play  
in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces  
kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the "" bad , "" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother  
finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist  
the one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil  
very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes  
perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder  
in "" awakenings , "" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed  
because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side  
the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) "
1,"aliens ! ! well , that is what this movie is about  
computer generated aliens  
ok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens  
it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib  
if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known  
the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits  
since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be  
well , in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft , squishy and cuddly kind  
just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark  
along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way  
j , well soon to be j , a smart ass cop ( played by will smith ) runs down what he thinks is a would-be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular  
k aims to recruit our poor j , but that is not the whole point of this movie  
the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge  
that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy  
some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty  
color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch  
the dialogue is witty to say the least  
this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie  
tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully  
the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them  
i would have to say that k is more amusing than j , but what's one without the other  
both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors  
the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless  
altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie  
a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor  
as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things  
the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be  
but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie  
especially the evil alien , he did need some work  
though this could have been worked on , the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy "
1,"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p  m  at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless )  
that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  
i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  
the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come  
we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  
she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  
maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed  
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  
this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  
nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  
when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  
considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  
and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting  
the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  
simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  
the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  
we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were  
i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film  
perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking "
1,"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general  
words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations  
the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context  
in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise  
same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime  
the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe  
his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro  
shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away  
after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely )  
upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba  
shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war  
thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary  
it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books  
those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre  
this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires  
unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work  
the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda  
christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role  
his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate  
his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends  
although the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character  
however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague  
this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director  
with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess  
luckily , the dogs of war had a good script  
irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel  
the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places  
in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes  
unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help  
but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama "

1,"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone  
to be specific , let me give you an example  
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? 
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled  
on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at  
our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles  
luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big  
the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler )  
one particularly striking m  o  
on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims  
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests  
she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service  
no points for guessing what they do  
her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job  
there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say  
gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see  
unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there   
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival  
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film  
there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction  
that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr  
jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability  
she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow  
it's a great performance  
reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste  
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler  
the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing  
of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result  
the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag "
1,"it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts  
but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut  
uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid  
but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious  
the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns  
george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks  
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station  
george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like "" wheel of fish "" and movies like "" conan , the librarian  "" 
as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate  
as r  j  
fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls  
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters  
the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed  
like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss  
for every gag that works , at least one fizzles  
for instance , weird al's mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation )  
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way  
in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since    
well , since airplane  
much of the credit goes to weird al's exceptionally inventive script and to the movie's winsome cast  
weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he's not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character  
the real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children's show : "" stanley spadowski's playhouse  "" 
stanley's off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star  
he is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness  
and above all , he's a good janitor who adores his work  
another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips  
the cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , "" wheel of fish "
1,"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell )  
when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine  "" 
i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea  
it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale  
the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it  
we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk  
he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this  
somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him  
it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade  
i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit  
however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer  
the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to  
the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original  
most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable  
thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development  
much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie  
pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would  
he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be  
we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him  
newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run  
as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed  
most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole  
the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar  
the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning  
back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering  
since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic  
my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure  
a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff  
we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful  
aside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development "
1,"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies  
i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven  
was it any good ? 
well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! )  
now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  
i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection  
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail  
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7  50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  
yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from  
as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  
as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring  
now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 
ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain  
throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  
how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved  
the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  
since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't  
 ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves )  
like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have  
 ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell )  
here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet )  
williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york  
they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes  
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done  
the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice  
danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way  
he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent ""  
he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners  
right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do "

1,"i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius  
when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure  
and when it doesn't work , it's just dull  
i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! 
is brilliant  
mars attacks ! 
is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas  
but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! 
has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it  
the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! 
portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are  
the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation  
the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping  
it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing  
the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes  
we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming  
but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton  
it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars  
anyone who comes to mars attacks ! 
expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses  
jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer  rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr  strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's "" kennedy room , "" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy  
sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j  fox is her newsman husband  
the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , "" they blew up congress ! "" 
and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace  
jim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president  
also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you )  
the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic  
with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive  
the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans  
the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons  
parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned  
the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! 
was in production long before that film's release  
cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks !

1,"wow ! what a movie  
it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original  
yep that pretty much describes this movie  
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen  
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often  
besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever  
period  
then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite  
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job  
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of  
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building    you 
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8  
he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer  
in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden  
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind  
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike  
he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind  
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all  
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened  
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play  
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast  
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive  
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date  
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself  
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever  
spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film  
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie  
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was "
1,"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling  
mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example  
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 
the plot is deceptively simple  
george washington carver high school is having student elections  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high  
mr  "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run  
and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons  
the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be  
you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have  
_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype  
what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier  
the similarities are staggering : 
tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive  
max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive  
the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined  
he even gets a bee sting  
the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined  
he gets several bee stings  
and so on  
what happened ? 
how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? 
even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy  
broderick here is playing the mr  rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then  
witherspoon is a revelation  
it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination  
and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over  
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it "

star trek : first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina 
star trek : first contact ( pg-13 ) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the "" even-odd pattern "" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are , well , not-so-good  
the pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci-fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series  
in this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt  cmdr  
data ( brent spiner ) , lt  cmdr  
geordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt  cmdr  
worf ( michael dorn ) , dr  beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige )  
the borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard )  
this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d  moore  
the other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials  
while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise  
not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while  
in the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole  
the story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care  
frakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect "

1,"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven  
that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
 "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality  
of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart  
carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not  
carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding  
being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite )  
he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison  
she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down )  
all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it  
sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate  
what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills  
like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle  
it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller  
de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films  
his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over )  
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  
to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  
this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history  
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome "

1,"this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree  
although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers  
it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one  
`a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why  
ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable  
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well  
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : 
1 ) period detail  
this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail  
shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head  
shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing  
on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration  
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality  
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like  
2 ) mom and dad  
both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles  
it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured  
for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues  
in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord  
his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment  
which brings us to     
3 ) the comic situations  
there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story'  
moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish  
i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard  
again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry  
the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree  
i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes "
1,"i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger  
i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought  
the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public  
since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla  , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign  
all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras  
people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions  
revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones  
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else  
even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes  
if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news  
either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks  
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial "" eat me "" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney )  
but weird things start happening  
a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father  
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm  
the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island  
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him  
as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else  
there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence  
the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions  
and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on  
he's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura  
most fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors  
the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this  
sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves  
and when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment  
but merge the two and you've got the truman show  
right now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ? 
one day , though , it could happen  
and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up "
1,"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , 
it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement  
with this and "" crimson tide , "" he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart  
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant  
 "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical  
it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be  
it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person  
i hate to do this , but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened  
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year  
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't  
will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect  
he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless  
he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one  
so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring    except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering "" id4 "" / "" men in black "" territory  
he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of "" six degrees of separation "" for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities  
smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee )  
the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it  
as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet  
these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends  
we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains  
they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world  
it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them  
unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that "" the game "" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on  
sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on  
but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked  
he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : "" days of thunder "" ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated  
his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention  
this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems "
1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick

1,"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker  
screenplay by andrew kevin walker  
inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving  
directed by tim burton  
starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien  
special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken  
synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation  
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them  
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery  
comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years  
batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels  
he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! )  
sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies  
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe  
christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders  
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s  
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein  
i mention these allusions for a reason  
seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film  
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this  
not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror  
the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie  
johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator  
depp is adequate in his role  
no more ; no less  
equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film  
she's a good witch too  
how cute  
one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters  
the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine "

1,"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast  
sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules  
but nothing entirely groundbreaking  
with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques  
it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be  
the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa  
but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib  
found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own  
we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight )  
of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero  
in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously  
gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here  
most of the characters are amusing without being forced  
as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture  
here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle  
of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie  
the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation  
directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel  
as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave  
your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment  
the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average  
there are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters  
there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here  
suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained  
the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost  
goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers  
glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child  
as the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton  
it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules  
a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence "
1,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again  
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10  
this one , however , is shockingly not bad  
in fact , it's actually good  
not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  
because it's cute and innocent fun  
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  
because the lead star is immensely appealing  
because the parents are also immensely appealing  
and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun  
there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third  
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week  
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" )  
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing  
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap  "" 
it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version  
it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it  
i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age  
watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence  
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better  
this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way  
it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right  
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way  
and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults  
the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents  
one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer  
she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing "
1," "" being john malkovich "" is the type of film we need to see more  
today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes  
malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur  
this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable  
john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time  
his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment  
when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk  
when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor  
it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time  
meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her  
the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever  
the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream  
being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies  
i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery  
in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant  
it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you  
it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue  
even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing  
it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion  
it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed  
other than that , i had a very enjoyable time  
the acting was quite delightful as well  
john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well  
he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change  
cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off  
john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice  
who else's mind would be better to explore ? 
the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project  
i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme  
he too is likely too receive media attention  
 "" being john malkovich "" isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite "

1,"for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor  
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? 
harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? 
with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster  
it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity  
for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood  
the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis )  
but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life  
the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair  
what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen  
shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives  
emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player  
patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car  
and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer  
pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it  
 "" why do we put up with it ? "" 
emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch  
 "" we try to talk about it , and look what happens  
we fight for 20 minutes  "" 
there's the admirable crux of this picture  
girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action  
but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take  
the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? )  
they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall  
 "" subvert the patriarchy , "" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to  
the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor  
still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying  
 ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it  ) 
perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( "" who you callin' a bitch ? "" )  
the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary  
long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste

1,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller  
in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isn't even fiction  
it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image  
in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies  
the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects  
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  
the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts  
the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece  
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles  
sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty  
on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  
shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn  
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward  
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard "

-1," * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once  
when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically  
such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button  
this fear of drama soured me on fast times    , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms  heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu  
has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ? 
attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger  
the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes  
they become walking wardrobes  
small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder  
he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam  
though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her  
 ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged  
dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions  
unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated  ) 
when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear )  
although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott  
she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend  
cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er    
 ( aside : simon & garfunkel's "" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme "" should never have been allowed in another motion picture  ) 
heckerling has a lot in common with nora "" you've got mail "" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women  
men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment  
 ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles  ) 
goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them  
heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes  
 ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal "

-1,"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? 
 "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter  
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable  
it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim  
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings  
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating  "" 
with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped  
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro )  
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization  
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom  
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing )  
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help  
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back  
the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right  
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all  
mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple  
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie  
everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism  
nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations  
every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about  
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash  
no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality  
it's like a dream without any appeal  
take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff  
they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don't move  
the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them  
you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob  
there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s  
secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed  
lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country's army "

it's one of those movies that's so bad it's absolutely hilarious , due in no small part to its big star , supermodel cindy crawford  
if you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues  
if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l  a  , you'll change your mind when you see fair game  
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition  
in a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course )  
we all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day  
nonetheless , someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer , but we're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes  
and for you horny teenage boys out there , you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark    
come to think of it , that may have been a body double  
cindy crawford isn't black , is she ? 
like i said , crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her  
billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ? 
alec ? 
adam ? 
kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion  
there's absolutely nothing original about this movie  
it's every cop show of the 70's mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90's  
three decades of crap all in one place , driven further into the ground by crawford's complete lack of acting talent  
and it's all completely predictable  
you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the "" sexual tension "" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie's going to suck from the first scene  
the plot isn't really explained until the end  
all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer  
in the words of one of the villains , "" we even know what size pantyhose she wears  "" 
 ( yeah , you and every 14-year-old boy in america  ) 
he goes on to add , "" we know more about her than she does  "" 
 ( _that_ i find very easy to believe  ) 
i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes , because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( "" if it weren't for me , you'd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba ! "" ) 
because , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue  
it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh  
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief "

the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro  
i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed  
with eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark  
when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong  
murphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job  
with his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt  
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott )  
finding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist  
but all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger  
metro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads  
in the first place , korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up )  
a reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies  
worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica  
you can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all "

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the film's science fares badly "
-1,"this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while  
with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors  
his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws  
obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake  
but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors  
it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories )  
casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school  
no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first  
while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic  
all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore )  
as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours  
half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in "" beverly hills "" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images  
the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects  
there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around  
i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ? 
there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended  
this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality  
but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind  
the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth  
johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents  
but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose  
and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid  
anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league  
dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also  
they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat  
and guess what ? 
that's about as complex as it gets  
oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a  k  a  doogie howser m  d "

-1,"i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday'  
it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football  
unfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers  
in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics  
we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook  
it grows tiresome and monotonous  
yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma  
matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go  
tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut  
aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad  
when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game  
once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field  
nerves , you see  
eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc  - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like  
and i believe it  
there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball  
the problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate  
football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush  
i guess he is mistaken  
`any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them  
many football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game  
in return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering  
in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction  
for instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch  
there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory  
the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance )  
unfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast  
pacino makes some interesting progress with his character  
you begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for "

-1,"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr  
magoo being a prime example  
the cartoon figure mr  magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images  
if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection  
for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan  
the story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject  
mr  magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it  
mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr  magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased  
like home alone 3 but without any class , mr  
magoo can only be described as painfully bad  
fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity  
the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off  
when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace  
mr  
magoo provides only three such moments  
the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm  
the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog  
angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture  
finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked  
rather than attempt to adapt mr  magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon  
he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny  
my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky  
hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not  
mr  magoo runs 1 : 37  
it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages "
-1,"upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases "" been there "" and "" done that "" come quickly to mind  
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series  
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff  
what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka  
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith  
along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act  
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical  
spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films  
the "" dick , the world is in danger  
what is it ? 
well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun   
 ( i'm paraphrasing ) "" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny  
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue  
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short  
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax  
as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context  
one of the more amusing was , "" captain of the enterprise       james 
t  kirk ""  
overall , i thought this was a very weak effort  
while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods  
next time they should "" spy "" a little bit harder

-1,"the first image in "" final fantasy : the spirits within "" is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye  
it's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing  
when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change  
the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed  
the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human  
she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person  
all the characters in "" final fantasy "" are like that  
of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show  
the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard  
none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist  
it gets worse when they talk and move  
why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ? 
why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? 
more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring "" hyperreal "" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ?

if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it  
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls  
most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities  
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr  sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach

-1,"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff  
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper  
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood  
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence  
continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need  
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? )  
oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities  
a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e  g  
marshall )  
while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault  
there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow  
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men  
the man ? 
he is the president of the united states of america  
where does the film go wrong ? 
it cannot be the acting  
clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances  
the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre  
the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone  
while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it  
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax  
rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness  
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant  
police officers are everywhere , incognito of course  
at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives  
all three parties are unaware of each others presence  
this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position  
he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations "
-1,"fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls  
being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story  
fair enough  
i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 "" this is a no-no "" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on "" it won't hurt ! "" 
for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes  
this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism  
they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics )  
rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate  
life is pain , highness  
get used to it  
she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest  
for children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated  
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap  
these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet )  
of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors  
i don't care  
gender be damned , she's borderline inept  
braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people  
don't be fooled  
this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed  
the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence  
twelve years old , a bundle of dough with a sour pout , the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance  
 ( her character is also named ana ? s  ) 
sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking  
it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room  
in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance  
the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob  
ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth  
she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour  
reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself  
if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided "
-1,"the first in a very long list of things wrong with "" i still know what you did last summer "" is the title  
think about it for a second  
if the last movie was called "" i know what you did last summer "" , wouldn't the next movie have to be "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" ? 
if anyone working on this movie had an i  q  
greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , "" hey    
wait a minute ""  
but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that  
what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick  
i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the "" kind of "" )  
it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did  
there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start  
first of all , i guess , is the setting  
the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting  
exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? 
the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through  
in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries  
when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue  
now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ? 
in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , "" just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time  "" 
oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway  
after all , it is in the script  
the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the "" re-animator himself , jeffrey combs  
he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie  
way to go , jeffrey  
i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson  
with "" scream "" and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter  
his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think "" i still know "" has really suffered by not having him on board  
the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one  
even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two "" scream "" s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other  
i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another "" the killer is back ! "" 
cliffhanger , he said "" who is this time , the grandma ? "" 
all in all , "" i still know "" tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt "
-1,"mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect  
a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  
however , mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  
jackie chan plays , who else , jackie  
this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  
there are only two scenes of him cooking  
for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop  
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 
a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons  
although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles    hmmm , 
shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 
anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape  
here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 
oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  
as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape  
this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie  
in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language  
however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases  
strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too  
whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films  
the plot in mr  nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons  
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread  
look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? 
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts  
the action is a mixed bag here "

-1,"it's time to take cover  
after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u  s "
-1,"nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy  
however half baked doesn't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more  
the plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners  
there's the group's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams )  
kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse  
when the animal keels over , he finds himself accused of killing a police officer , and facing a $1 , 000 , 000 bail  
his friends promise to raise money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how  
that is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor  
soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii )  
for a comedy , the film is pretty humorless  
not that it doesn't try    it's 
just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat  
the four leads are nearly all playing the same character  
only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another )  
to help out , the film is packed full of cameos  
steven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another  
none of them work , beyond the simple "" hey , that's _____ "" level  
in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle  
not as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot  
granted , it's pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren't a ton of laughs    but this film needs every one it can scrape up  
to top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true )  
her role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong  
her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the "" your film promotes the use of drugs "" camp  
the film would have been better off by sticking with the "" rebel "" tone it so eagerly tries to claim  
yet , in the end , it doesn't really matter "
-1," "" virus "" is a monster movie without a monster  
any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise  
sadly , "" virus "" does not deliver , on any level  
the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it  
sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat  
cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures  
see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money  
at least , i * think * that's what they do  
along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained  
so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters  
the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg  
yes , borg  
complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye  
apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical  
so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for "" spare parts ""  
blah , blah , blah  
i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't  
suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! )  
everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies  
for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , "" tetsuo-the iron man ""  
and the plot is right out of "" aliens ""  
the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie  
i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated "" deep rising ""  
but "" virus "" , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster  
it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption  
 "" virus "" is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it  
besides the lame "" monster "" , it's chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into  
for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! 
now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it  
that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life  
finally , "" virus "" isn't scary "
-1,"once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero  
the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability  
some of these excursions were fun  
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action  
and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? 
i'll explain  
knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong  
marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider )  
they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business  
i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one  
i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow  
tommy is really working with the cia  
his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons  
he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys  
if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off  
if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea  
knock off sucks  
it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares  
it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star  
the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe  
director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot  
i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous  
the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired  
it all sounds very cool  
trust me , it isn't  
as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible  
sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease  
he looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired  
i hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr  van damme to give up his day job  
it's really a test of endurance watching knock off "

-1,"disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand  
there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide  
richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen )  
once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise  
this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel  
the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking  
i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning  
but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography  
though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking  
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts  
this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better  
now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise  
this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable  
there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples )  
i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me  
the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child  
although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher  
the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does  
the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough  
richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line  
this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused  
now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it )  
the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard  
mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better  
which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? 
 ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it )  
but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible  
the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable  
not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense  
when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable  
i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story "

-1,"when considering david fincher's latest film , "" the game "" , four words come to mind  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isn't simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn )  
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
 "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it  
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening  
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven  
the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall  "" 
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation  
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn  
in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't  
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed  
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
 "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  
as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles  
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  
is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? 
no ? well , how about sharon stone ? 
thought so )  
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films "
-1,"first troy beyer wrote the critically panned "" b  a  p  s  "" 
now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex  
though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad  
the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love  
jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating  
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami  
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters  
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film  
there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension  
in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid  
that is not the case here  
the script suffers from random plot developments  
there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" 
at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along  
we've never seen her mother before  
we never see her again  
who cares ? 
what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy  
at another point , a character announces that she can't have children  
apparently , this is devastating  
we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her  
the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow  
these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax  
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing  
one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters  
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax  
thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities  
but it does "

-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant "
-1,"despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances  
so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is  
it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse  
something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own )  
the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw )  
this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find  
meanwhile , scientist dr  laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes  
it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive  
it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does  
 "" this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! "" 
exclaims one character in the early going  
in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong  
the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected  
looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's "" black cancer "" to me  
but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from  
species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did  
human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h  r  giger )  
a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? 
aliens sans flamethrowers  
the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc  keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here  
after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge  
however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment  
at one point she's called on to play alien "" empath "" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell  
by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch  
so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard  
one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control  
the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that  
helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along "

-1,"8mm is not going to enlighten your day  
it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence  
not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well  
nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late  
he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality  
cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability  
at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of  
his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe  
the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered  
or so it seems  
welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth  
and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head  
he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography  
max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change  
the devil changes you  ' 
these turn out to be very wise words  
8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution  
the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her  
this is where everything goes awry  
although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula  
everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects  
although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control  
cage is the film's sole flame of energy  
his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation  
still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand  
welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry  
this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film  
he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie  
written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece  
furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? 
the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) "
-1,"man , this was one wierd movie  
similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is  
the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship  
the last half hour ? 
this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - "" screw it , let's just kill everybody ""  
from then on - forget sci-fi    this 
movie becomes 100% horror  
what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way  
instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore      yawn     everyone's 
seen it all before and knows when to expect it  
the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew  
there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? 
then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video  
the acting isn't too bad at all      considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of  
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space  
this movie could have been so much better  
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with "

-1,"bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures  
mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined  
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale  
art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent  
you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist  
enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant  
he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says  
naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government  
lt  col  nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury  
however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code  
naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l  l  
ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard  
and that's where art jeffries comes in  
for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy  
in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall  
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous  
why bother trying to kill the kid    i 
mean , who would know ? 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher  
and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken  
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it    but 
i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here  
for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser )  
the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot "

strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb  "" 
now , sadly , he's added "" eyes wide shut "" to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook  
kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead  
this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut  
kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler's 1926 novella "" dream story , "" has confused eroticism with nudity  
he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly  
he has confused profundity with pretentiousness  
in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out  
pollack , the director of such box-office hits as "" tootsie "" and "" out of africa , "" is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth    
and there isn't much depth to begin with ! 
unhappily , there's not likely to be a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one  
in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film  
it doesn't help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous  
cruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford  
he's a doctor and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address  
at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who's singularly determined to get her in the sack  
bill , too , is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he's pulled away to deal with an overdoser  
back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice's aggressive jealousy kicks in  
as retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed  
this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman  
it's all way too much for him  
for revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker  
he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store  
then he almost does the hooker's roommate  
and he's almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and "" the women are incredible "" ( i  e  , naked )  
this "" erotic "" set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it's a lot less shocking than it's intended to be "

-1," "" it was not scary  "" 
these are the first words that came to mind after it was over  
when a movie is called _vampires_ , "" not scary "" aren't words that should be associated with it  
but that wasn't my only gripe  
john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_  
unfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach  
with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan  
the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people  
like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack  
their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks  
to commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away  
their celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team  
woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee )  
although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire  
the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years  
along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl  
upham in _saving private ryan_  
some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen  
_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest  
only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick  
but it's too little too late  
we get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we're dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) 
interestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick  
woods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride  
and his motive for killing vampires ? 
take a wild guess  
 ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____  ) 
at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness  
_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot  
to make up for this , the movie resorts to other "" shocks , "" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to "" getting woodies  "" ) 
it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie  
if not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting "

-1,"mr  bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting  
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride  
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick  
either way look out america bean is coming  
well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot  
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy  
it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help  
the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed  
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went  
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece  
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid  
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems  
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner  
well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure  
i have to concede that mr  atkinson's acting in this movie is well done  
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is  
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie  
now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting  
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie  
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved  
one thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results  
tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers  
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek  
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved  
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly  
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless  
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie  
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie "

-1,"`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  
to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  
something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun  
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror  
judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move  
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably  
done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  
unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong  
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward  
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  
these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people  
boy , are these bats ugly  
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart  
they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do  
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  
but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers  
the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores  
on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations  
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude  
even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed  
the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc    )  
the scientist is dr  sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field'

hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you , jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video  
it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one  
wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 
what's it about ? 
jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show  "" 
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley )  
soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch  
wh : can we guess who wins ? 
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score  
on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair  
they're not just boring ; they're lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc : warren fouls off a fastball  
1 and 1  
wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 
jb : not one , from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh  
the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing

-1," "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  
it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  
and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents  
it's worse than that  
it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness  
or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness  
in certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb  
in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens  
there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out  
this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  
what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and 
discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  
as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened  
this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch    then 
it takes one wrong step  
we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out  
but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  
it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting  
it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible  
events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina  
that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay  
this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena  
what went wrong ? 
depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this "

-1,"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music  
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea  
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged  
unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original  
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended  
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died  
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together  
john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable  
first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie )  
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band  
next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band  
finally , there's buster ( j  
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band  
the plotting of the film is hardly original    it 
seems to be almost a clone of the original  
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale  
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role  
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original  
remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 
well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music  
there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat  
there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown )  
there are plenty of recurring characters too  
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs  murphy  
frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden  
as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy  
aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood  
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack "

-1,"the most interesting part of "" can't hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to  
that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored  
the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party    almost 
too nicely  
for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film  
we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place  
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this  
after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with  
everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers  
except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there )  
unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film  
the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything  
however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes  
we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them  
and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being  
here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the "" american grafitti "" or , to a lesser extent , the "" dazed and confused "" cliche  
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party  
 "" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand  
we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of "" that thing you do ! "" ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart  
now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her    even 
though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? )  
since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile  
ugh  
the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused , "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably "" sixteen candles  "" 
the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion  
this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes "
-1," "" there will be another , "" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? 
true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway  
the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world  
given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions  
of course , it doesn't  
stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death  
i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality  
in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind  
it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating  
city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully  
there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success  
in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings  
 ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow  ) 
so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup  
this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead  
perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face  
at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave  
he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film  
kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank  
tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress  
the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve  
iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film  
like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination  
in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand  
even the soundtrack is tired  
more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look  
critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se  
he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery  
his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie  
but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved

a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands  
it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance  
indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times  
no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year  
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! ""  
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late  
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history  
unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature  
based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother  
if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania  
the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will  
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see  
but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end  
the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum  
frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving  
in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters  
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions  
crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain  
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers  
ah , but there is dunaway's performance  
and what a delicious piece of campery it often is  
having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden  
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making  
spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! ! 
fetch me the axe ! ! "" 
with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling  
in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers  
oh dear ! 
sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ? 
this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no    wire  "
-1,"i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy  
boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment ! 
after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater ! 
read on to see what i have to say     
four rooms : 
starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye  
possible stars ) 
 "" four rooms "" was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year  
key word here : "" supposed  "" 
four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast  
i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great  
the plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job  
he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems  
tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script  
it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy  
anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them  
the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot  
this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife  
the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite  
the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger  
the movie was just plain trash  
there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film  
it was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film  
tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film  
the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals  
marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role  
this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat "" plaza suite , "" but it wasn't  
as trashy as it was , some people will call it classic  
do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna's chest showing a classic film ?

-1,"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge  
such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c  clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k  dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth  
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings  
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved  
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own  
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre  
with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe  
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission  
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son  
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney )  
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance  
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them  
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet  
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars  
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface  
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars'  
a strange noise emanates from the rock  
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc  
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing  
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team  
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger  
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface  
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars  
and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
now for the bad news  
the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe  
the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed  
borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole "

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either "
-1,"one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , "" you'd better watch out for the skin deep  "" 
i'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don't watch skin deep  
skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards  
john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem  
i never saw edwards' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake  
you see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets  
as the movie opens , zach's wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress' hairdresser  
like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him  
in response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery  
if you're turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley  
skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters  
zach is a rich , '80s l  a  version of ritter's jack tripper character from "" three's company  "" 
like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he's the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye  
zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him  
consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis  
in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony  
to add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work  
for instance , vincent gardenia's talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender  
of all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach's wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role  
because we don't care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail  
the comedy in skin deep doesn't fare much better  
most of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish  
about every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of "" dueling "" condoms  
overall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat  
my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism  
zach's excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain  
zach's drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences  
if he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one "

carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's "" ghosts of mars "" )  
like all those films prefixed by the very possessive "" john carpenter's , "" "" ghosts of mars "" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects  
in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic )  
dormant martians ( i  e  , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes  
all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- "" species "" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train  
officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james "" desolation "" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture  
in the second category we have ms  henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named "" desolation "" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try too hard  
in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also )  
state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department  
 "" ghosts of mars "" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry  
the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly  
carpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts  
it's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken  
i never thought i'd miss the guy but i do  
it's not * all * the same , however  
dubbed the "" one-note wonder "" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work  
fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue  
the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless  
mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn "" mission to mars "" and "" red planet "" ( with val kilmer )  
 "" ghosts of mars "" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them "" american pie 2 "" and "" rush hour 2 "" )  
the irony is that the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent  
there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor  
two things keep "" john carpenter's ghosts of mars "" from getting a huge slap upside the head "

as a love story it is good , however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face  
i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times    and 
those were just chuckles at the most ! 
the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie  
wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j  d  mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end

wayne and j  d  however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it's up to wayne and j  d  to try and begin saving silverman  
the performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat  
jason biggs right off the flop "" loser "" does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times  
steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself  
jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j  d  but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past  
amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he's better at singing than acting )  
anyway the performances in the film are good , but it's too bad the script isn't  
speaking of script , hank nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street

patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother  
as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest  
the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes  
i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school  
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing  
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? 
look at what i can do ! 
i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or  "" 
maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! )  
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it  
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  
arrrrrrrghhhh  
  
  
then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  
though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script "
-1,"the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission  
he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses  
after they ricochet off his face , he says , "" not a good start  "" 
as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well  
in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed "" condor "" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war  
for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u  s  embassy in spain  
i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart  
watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe  
the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned  
it's almost a guarantee  
anyway     
condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly  
to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo )  
there aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something  
although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts  
in fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight  
i suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway  
if you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves  
they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human  
knowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting  
you've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art  
also of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor  
as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them  
what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes  
unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining "

-1,"i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper  
it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film  
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible  
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies  
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures  
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie  
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video  
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu )  
audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film  
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job  
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here  
and the kid actors are great , as well  
but we're talking about the script from hell  
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  
furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  
take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  
they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin  
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless "

-1,"when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of "" mr  magoo , "" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay  
mr  
magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented  
in fact , they were wrong  
mr  
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity  
it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas  
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr  
magoo  
the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining  
the worst , mr  
magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be  
the first problem with mr  
magoo is the script  
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr  
magoo is comically barren  
from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found  
every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud  
you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case  
i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures  
then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus )  
in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun  
lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr  
magoo  
even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here  
this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation  
the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber  
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often  
the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) "

of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter  
pretty good premise , no ? 
critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller  
and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well  
sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole "" psychiatrist working against the clock "" thing , actually had me engaged at first  
but it's at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers  
we get the overly smart kid who manages to "" pull one "" over on the bad guys  
we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy  
we get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot  
and what about the film's main plot point ? 
why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day's end to do his part ? 
 ( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? )  
i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why ! 
and many , many more  
ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? 
i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke  
and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions  
badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone  
in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right ! 
watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool "" regular guy "" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture  
incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ? 
she was completely superfluous  
and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow  
ooooh , thanks , mr  fleder    i 
appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude    yum , 
yum    but 
how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ? 
whatever  
either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it  
see it if you like dumb thrillers "

-1,"well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task  
he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films  
in a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one  
eraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense  
batman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes  
now in 1999 , "" end of days "" ( not "" the end of days "" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold  
is this the end of a powerful action star's long-lived career ? 
will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( "" terminator "" , "" terminator 2 : judgement day "" , "" predator "" ) ? 
or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( "" commando "" , "" red sonja "" , "" true lies "" ) ? 
it doesn't look that way  
 "" end of days "" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan's baby the hour before new year's of 2000  
fortunately for the movie's sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers  
it's an action film's dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up  
imagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office  
arnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant  
if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it  
jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it  
jericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name  
arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can  
he shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil  
in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; "" you are a @#$^% ! & 
choir boy ! 
you are a choir boy ! "" 
those two lines marked the high points of this film  
a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor  
 "" end of days "" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne  
byrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie  
he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time  
the annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho  
i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody  
the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances  
kevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one )  
the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line  
robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan's baby with extreme annoyance  
she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience  
in one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off "

-1,"eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights  
as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails  
but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds  
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy  
here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time  
they gonna get sexy  
they gonna get funny  
they gonna get drama  
they gonna get all of that  
i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network )  
here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense )  
and guess who's to blame ? ! 
the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film  
no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled  
murphy's awful script is the culprit  
let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : 
 ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture  
yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw  
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word  
and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating  
 ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast  
richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes  
each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle  
 ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men  
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there  
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether  
you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff  
for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach  
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head  
this is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! 
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy  
thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer  
 ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date "
-1," "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year  
it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand  
is it as bad as advertised ? 
oh yes , very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringe-inducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear  
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta )  
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
  
  ) 
so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go  
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  
of course , his plan doesn't work  
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 
early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" 
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo  
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees "

-1,"while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting  
in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone  
she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  
unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands  
giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies  
giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser  
naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy  
paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city  
paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul  
paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari )  
dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided  
they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser  
i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting  
jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence  
they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't  
then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort  
in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk )  
instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic  
she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma )  
she simply turns the film into a pity party  
since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated  
instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them  
paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing  
his roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name  
and professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave  
dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail  
there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush  
and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow   "

-1," "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while  
not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid  
unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven's gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad  
instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place  
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? 
of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek )  
most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps  
therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others  
 "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts  
 "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue  
the script , by bayard johnson and j  anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come  
comic books have better plots than this  
the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy "" george of the jungle  "" 
didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? 
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage  
when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week  
however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle  
at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man  
once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city  
most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of  
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 )  
when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river  
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality  
for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do  
instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival  
of course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is  
not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city  
there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie )  
which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? 
strictly speaking , "" tarzan and the lost city "" isn't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close  
this movie proves what "" starship troopers "" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle  
van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth "

-1,"a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche  
a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche  
a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche  
a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche  
at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche  
complaining about cliches = cliche  
ok , ok  
so we always hear about cliches  
but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! 
not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen  
they might as well use this as a training film : "" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's ""  
karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison  
she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive  
aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past  
he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt  
and if she refuses ? 
who knows what he'll do to the kid  
 ( cue sinister laughter ) 
this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin  
the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant  
i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot "" twist "" , etc  , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera  
basinger is absolutely vacant  
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ? 
here's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we're supposed to feel sorry for her  
as she confronts her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ? 
especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever  
i suppose i should mention val kilmer  
yeah , that's right - he's in it ! 
quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name  
and he got second billing ! 
to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j  t  
barker  
unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , 
we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project  
the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie  
the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra "
-1,"bats is this year's camp flick  
with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity  
as for the rest of us , well    
i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway  
follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot  
i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based  
it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats  
when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate  
it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious  
why has he done this , you ask ? 
because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things "" a little better , "" even if that means the death of all mankind  
so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world  
of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture  
consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave  
the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out  
what do they do ? 
do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? 
nope  
they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes  
what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes  
we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick  
all we know is that bats are attacking  
how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery  
a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some  
of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere  
most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like "" i hate bats ! "" 
some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept  
i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners  
playing such characters does not help actors' careers  
still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is "" so bad it's good , "" you could do worse than bats  
it does have a tremendous amount of camp value  
i'm not "" recommending "" the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it "
-1,"forget get carter  
instead    
get me a cup of coffee  
what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? 
did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? 
when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads  
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city  
get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown  
stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up  
a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey  
that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul  
stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past  
too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges  
get carter is a simple story  
stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore )  
when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter's way ""  
he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee  
carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough  
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties  
what a minute ! 
this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey  
better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off  
actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing )  
while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose  
throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously  
his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character  
there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words  
the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke  
an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character  
he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book  
get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud "
-1,"capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived  
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead , they got john r  leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a  ) the director's style , b  ) the special effects , & c  ) the treatment of the story and characters  
a  ) mr  leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  
apparantly , everybody can now fly  
hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly  
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess  
in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back  
or at least let robin shou direct    
b  ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad  
i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious "

-1,"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3  
they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning  
you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news  
no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise  
something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car  
 ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture  ) 
of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? 
the backseat ? 
the next car ? 
thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering  
what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff  
our other surviving regulars have become estranged  
sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program  
murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death  
the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour    or a combination of people  
scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive  
ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  
with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent  
conceptually  the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2  the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" 
in reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating  
with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of "" stab 3 "" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven  
craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects  
how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny  
it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress )  
the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before  
 ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) 
finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent  
sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score  
i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs  
the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' "

-1,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value  
it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point  
the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series  
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  
john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense  
the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one  
their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing  
the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  
we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville  
first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr  nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  
which explains the film's mythic theme    as 
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  
the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role  
at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense  
soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  
before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone  
he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust "
-1,"okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? 
whew  okay  
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe  
even i know that you need more footage than * that *  
and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves  
the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie  
at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace  
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die  
a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received  
later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom  
and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary  
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc  ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good  
some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice  
can't beat that )  
all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected  
not romantic at all , and only funny in some places  
so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? 
or the fairy godfather ? 
she can * float * now too ? 
and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? 
tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's "" witchcraft "" in the end ? 
would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ? 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? 
it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome  
the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables  
the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls )  
gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming "" cruel intentions "" ) than this sorry excuse for a character  
it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible  
the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in "" you've got mail "" ( see footnotes )  
and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places  
this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too  
 "" simply irresistible "" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick  
and how could i refrain from making a pun ? 
  
  
  
 "" simply irresistible "" is all too easy to resist "
-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out "

-1,"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion  
joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer  
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup  
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical  
the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him  
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school  
joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents  
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch  
the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever  
his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes  
this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist  
now , that's a smart kid  
but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends  
one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing  
throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) 
question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class  
nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted  
what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody  
the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) 
tells him his grandfather is all right  
his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well ,    
maybe that's for another film down the road  
this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo  
as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose  
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better  
well , god bless him , if he can do that  
this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood  
it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god  
and that family of his , they're too good for words  
yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place "

-1,"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story  
but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought  
for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction  
our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be  
brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy ""  
regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well  
his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing  
true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins  
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily  
the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors  
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino  
more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively  
donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious  
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music  
inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us  
it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's  
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface  
in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations  
donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them  
 ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! "" 
i hear from springfield way ? ) 
so the movie is cliched  
big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? 
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre  
donnie brasco fails on both counts  
the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades  
admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr  white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm  
depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style  
the consequences are painful to watch  
its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent  
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco  
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks "
-1,"have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? 
well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation  
but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond  
oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc  
in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down  
using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office  
the law firm's employees get a good chuckle  
the audience gets a good chuckle  
the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd )  
there is something compelling about this mysterious woman  
despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her  
after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago  
after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state  
the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions  
but he does not alert the authorities  
he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss  
the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past  
his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life  
his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation  
she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman  
he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation  
it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders  
and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens  
he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble  
when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking  
when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape  
all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight  
peculiar  
how bad is this movie ? 
i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test  
just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes  
for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella "
-1,"whenever u  s  government starts meddling into other countries' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says "" look who's talking ! 
what have you done to the indians ? "" 
however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes  
hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s  
those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america  
one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers  
the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century  
when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u  s  government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation  
however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless  
with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign  
general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u  s  army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest  
instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt  charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall )  
together with young lt  britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo  
geronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors  
so , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies  
almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people  
although such elements of john millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo  
to be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time  
instead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band  
to make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers  
the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood  
the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting  
wes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role  
contrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies "
-1,"'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
chris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs  doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  
based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult  
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  
soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin ( sam neill ) very curious  
andrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  
it shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul  
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  
then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do  
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love  
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  
ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  
what makes us human ? 
the thoughts ? 
the emotions ? 
is it possible to become human ? 
at what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? 
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  
it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously  
when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it  
in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards  
further more , there are other annoying problems  
to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now  
this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task  
columbus is the first to have crossed that line  
the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort  
the world is simply frozen in time  
neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years  
mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes  
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference  
i am not saying that everything should change "

-1,"set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster "" families "" go to war over control of "" the numbers "" , an illegal gambling lottery  
 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table "
-1,"suicide is pointless , everyone should know that  
so what's this movie like ? 
you guessed it    
pointless  
the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them  
when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever  
that's what the press materials for the film probably say  
now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time  
boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as    
well as committing suicide  
the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window  
the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on  
then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on  
is that a joke ? 
is that supposed to be amusing in some way ? 
from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in  
performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides  
woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well  
dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well  
and while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed  
there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more  
as a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since    
well since eddie and the cruisers )  
perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters  
we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling  
all we really know is that mrs  lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash "

-1,"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air  
the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl  
the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met  
if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should  
cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained  
and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h  i  mcdonnough  
cage should have known what he was getting himself into  
he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production  
the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance  
in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time  
that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness  
while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact  
audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production  
in fact , the marketing people are counting on it  
no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded  
director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland )  
what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense  
a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely  
if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up  
at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool  
their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them )  
in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts  
it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance  
while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u  s  marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep  
his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies  
it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over "
-1,"the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence  
it's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense  
and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? 
james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor  
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train  
at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role  
chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop  
he's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown  
that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg )  
nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life  
what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me  
i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann )  
i'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff  
i'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way  
there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story  
one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense  
i don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director  
i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act  
one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner  
he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me  
 ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all  ) 
there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent  
there's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents  
the plot itself never straightens out  
i'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group  
the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences  
the sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? 
on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? 
one too many , i'd imagine  
foley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here  
the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together  
chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep  
wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch "

-1,"i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development  
hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  
plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people  
critique : "" speed on an ice-cream truck "" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for  
this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr  , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written "" , that we just had to crack up  
that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it    3 scenario ! 
and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters     "" elvis "" 
and "" nighshift "" , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel )  
it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project  
did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? 
most probably the latter  
have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? 
well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here  
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals

-1,"plot summary : the year is 2024  
the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod  
the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid  
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope  
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation  
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up  
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? )  
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off  
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield  
katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander  
if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc  ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr  connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
maybe they could pull it off  
instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film  
it's as if they are different people with the same names  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ? 
the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out  
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before  
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying  
i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill  
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ?

do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? 
well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half    only to make up and hug in the end  
aaaaaaaahhhh    
plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill  
critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special  
and i'm being nice ! 
how junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit  
the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot  
wow    how 
deep  
of course , the same christmas tune that's played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build "" bonds "" among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars  
stop me    i'm 
gonna cry again ! 
this film is a mess  
the characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an "" emotional "" moment about movie stars from the 50s  
admittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film  
meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in  
enough already ! 
and diane keaton must've spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best  
neither one convinced in "" emotional "" scenes  
granted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that's probably where my rating of three points comes from  
all in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you're one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( "" oh no , please don't get any flour on my donna karan dress ! )  
ugh  
i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something ! 
that'll teach 'em to mess with you ! 
oh and incidentally , mrs  joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there ! 
then again "
-1,"violence is bad  
violence is ugly  
violence breeds yet more violence  
kids , don't try this at home  
this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest  
written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles  
 ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia  ) 
if you piss a "" family "" member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs  
a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another  
it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from  
unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work  
there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what  
then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family  
granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense  
instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again  
the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning  
there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose  
all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend  
he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away  
another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes  
though slow moving , brother does have good elements  
the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch  
some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for  
the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do  
shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination  
their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show  
also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism  
a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash  
sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily  
it's a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up "
-1,"to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery  
it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history  
it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible  
worse , there's the promise of a sequel  
why ? ! 
save your money  
some films go quickly to video  
this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre  ' 
in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species  
most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos )  
survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives  
the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons  
dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage  ' 
travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth  
much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations  
he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter  
but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth  
when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan  
he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site  
it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it  
the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader  
a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how  
but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox  
this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment  
it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors  
`we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says  
`but first , we need a few more supplies  ' 
in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts  
by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl  
the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel  
numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning "

the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films "
-1,"drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others  
she has perfected these characters in movies such as "" the wedding singer "" and , most notably , "" ever after  "" 
now she's back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - "" never been kissed  "" 
you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary  
trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don't mean steve ) invented the printing press  
the premise is simple  
barrymore's josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens are feeling and doing  
josie ( she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance  
this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd  
now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence  
these are among the many problems that plague "" never been kissed  "" 
screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie  
their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation  
and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school's most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability  
ok , so "" never been kissed "" is not a sociological expose of today's high school scene  
however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character  
among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment  
any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say "" get me rewrite  "" 
to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with  
she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her  
barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler  
otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations  
 "" never been kissed "" is entertaining and funny in fits and starts  
it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish  
the movie's main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie  
josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls  
real mature  
and that is the main deficiency with "" never been kissed  "" 
it's illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding  
it has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles "

-1,"here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? 
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  
in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was  
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions  
we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers  
i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me  
on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both )  
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  
the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting  
in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie  
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? 
probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  
in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j  o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation  
their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes  
the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  
aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board  
the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  
the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque )  
williams , once a "" can't miss "" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  
famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams  
given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes  
unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture  
meanwhile , kevin j  o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard  
these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects  
this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn  
the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past  
now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where "" reality "" begins "

-1,"seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
the big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one  
gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis  
 "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre  
it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for  
audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects  
battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens  
in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking  
we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources  
each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people  
professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play )  
of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments  
the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable  
the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! )  
we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent  
in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent  
yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk  
they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) )  
it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens  
eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not  
the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr  smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage  
what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts  
the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite  
the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive  
but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly  
plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario  
the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring "
-1,"the formula is simple  
trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one  
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few )  
so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? 
 ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example  ) 
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas  
deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film  
treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity    no 
questions asked  
this time , however , they may have gone too far  
their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films  
and their cargo    let's 
just say it has very high explosive potential  
what is the target of these thieves ? 
why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage  
but something else is hunting the argonauticus    something 
ancient and deadly  
by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed  
and now the creature senses fresh meat ! 
so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep  
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one  
fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer  
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food  
if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be  
it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when  
there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end  
for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first "

-1,"the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending  
watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise  
when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification  
this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more  
good surprises make movies fun to watch  
then there are the bad twists  
you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid  
screwed perfectly suits the latter description  
what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on  
by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs  
larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing  
whoops  
screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments  
norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch )  
when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars  
too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home  
now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping  
of course , everything that could go wrong does  
the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad  
but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear  
the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes  
at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : "" no , you idiot ! "" 
i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film  
a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive  
they give real cops bad names  
also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days  
looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief  
he just didn't belong in this movie  
macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte  
if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel  
otherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money "

-1,"you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man  
while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies  
even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film  
it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly  
i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good  
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved  
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  
things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland )  
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous  
the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years  
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial  
through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell  
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting  
as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas  
the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action  
gooding jr  does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual  
the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work )  
nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct  
unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting  
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots  
first , we have the prison warden subplot  
the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine  
there's also the prison guard subplot  
the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion  
then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man  
if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films

-1,"so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? 
well , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here  
this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! 
it's like i said    this 
movie sucks  
plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet  
critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie  
uneven , would be another  
the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go "" somewhere ""  
but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix  
in a sci-fi movie ? 
well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement  
ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact  
mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well  
of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story  
ugh  
what a friggin' mess  
films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again  
didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? 
didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! )  
of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians  
'nuff said  
neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful    wow    yawn    my 
ears hurt ! ) "

-1,"back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman  
that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle    
last action hero  
but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and "" got lost  "" 
if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe  
you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film  
at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in  
to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not  
after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr  smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's "" stream "" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting  
they encounter another ship  
they board it  
alien spiders attack them  
they return to their ship  
the other one explodes  
they land on a deserted planet  
and so on  
an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on  
the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that  
for a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy  
in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like    
digital effects  
but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny's pet  
entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game  
apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ? 
but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious  
you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy "

or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir  
or even -- god help me -- palmetto  
alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere  
i screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater ! "" 
new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back  
i paid $4  25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either  
you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie  
i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras  
i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care  
the movie starts out oh-so-promising  
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago  
there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory  
the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life  
all well and good , right ? 
wrong  
apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot  
 ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood  ) 
so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible  
it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca  
no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca  
it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode  
>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here )  
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot  
what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense  
we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed  
we're given a hero who can "" tune "" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot  
we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 
usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part "" isn't given much to do  "" 
in this movie , no one is given anything to do "
-1,"capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain  
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse  
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability "

-1,"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight  
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show  
when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt  
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back  
when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv  
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king  
after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view  
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin  
yes , i do    
1  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans  
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously  
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously  
i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 
i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has  
2  there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title  
this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in  
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  
3  
the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him  
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! 
4  why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? 
i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end  
5  
in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan  
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair  
wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? 
i hate that

-1,"everybody in this film's thinking of alicia  
no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the "" cryin' "" video  
this is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed  
first off , there's zero sex , almost no nudity , and it's not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks  
well , anyway  
the "" plot  "" 
alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j  t  
walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party  
the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters' thoughts , except alicia's  
the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher  
first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in "" mallrats , "" and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from "" suburbia "" ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again )  
they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky  
somethine like that  
the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters' thoughts  
we get to see jeremy and nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j  t  
thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal  
it even shows them in bed together  
yea  
i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in "" flirting with disaster  "" 
the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on  
like we care about any of the characters  
the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she's alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies  
so i guess she's some kind of mystery or something  
but she is never explored further  
so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly )  
i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film  
i mean , there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they're just as good as sleeping pills  
and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film "
-1,"plot : a rich guy who doesn't believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself  
that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter  
but what's this ? 
one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? 
wow    a 
sin , indeed  
critique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year  
too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie  
what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? 
 ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience  
have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ? 
well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! 
i say again    what the shite were they thinking ? 
okay , so where do i start ? 
first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal  
so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two "" lovers "" go through the motions until the "" betrayal "" occurs  
whoopee , big surprise  
second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part  
why ? 
well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! 
i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here  
every look in jolie's eyes screams "" psycho "" ! 
then of course , you have the case of the "" patsy "" husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time  
i mean    how 
boring is that for the audience ? 
you're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude  
no , thanks ! 
and if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? 
well , i'll tell you  
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled  
no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending  
so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? 
well , it's actually pretty simple  
i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record )  
everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid

-1,"toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes  
this carl "" apollo creed "" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs  evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer  
somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs  
weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques  
speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , "" you tore his arm off ! "" 
jackson replies , "" he had a spare  "" 
jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t  nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson  
after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , "" i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends  "" 
 "" not unless they changed the definition , "" jackson glowers  
and of course it turns out stone is mrs  dellaplane  
faux pas , jackson    
not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa  
it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own )  
wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson  
she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub  
after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , "" i expected a standing ovation  "" 
he responds , "" you're getting one , "" and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time  
prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs    
or at least the prince  
it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie  
action jackson is another variation on the "" unlikely partners "" buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around  
this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement  
my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , "" i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head  "" 
jackson's response is , "" i think i felt that way once "
-1,"the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting  
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers )  
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  
it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky  
does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
the answer : it looked cool  
or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 
the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music  
nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood  
no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  
as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard  
he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous "

i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie    
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone's talent  
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me  
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me  
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me  
and to anybody who decided that this project was "" funny "" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci    well ,

just don't have the words  
so is this the worst movie that i've seen all year ? 
no  but it definitely sucks and it's basically because    well , 
it's just not funny  
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it  
it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else    lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting   "
-1,"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge  
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise  
after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom  
the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping    
and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 
love  
so far , so mediocre  
but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance  
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status  
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture  
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand  
not that there is much of a romance to begin with  
try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters  
celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard  
as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other  
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural  
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish  
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting  
the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling  
and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue  
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool  
instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name  
my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar  
after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter  
the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport  
alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end  
i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill  
a life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary  
 "" i can accept failure "

ah , how sweet the irony ! 
it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance  
he just doesn't "" understand "" shakespeare , you will hear them say  
the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism  
what a load of old cobblers  
if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's "" comedy "" much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life  
get monty python  
get woody allen  
get john waters  
whatever  
just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy  
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs  
drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength  
to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever  
no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going  
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages  
but boy , does she owe me one ! 
i won't spend too much time on the plot  
basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older  
there's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it  
mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story  
good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound  
nothing wrong with most of the cast , either  
branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers  
the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text  
light comedy shouldn't be complex  
yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend  
for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh  
the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something  
but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame  
this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold "

-1,"i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous  
in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point  
but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie  
this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws  
get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie  
travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson )  
it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell )  
let the investigation begin  
with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case  
things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve  
woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar  
with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable  
here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room  
there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb  
director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it  
the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess  
it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace  
a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package  
from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this  
still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits  
the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast  
the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here )  
madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently  
one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable  
>from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question  
the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end  
in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films  
the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly  
the general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time  
but it just could have been so much better "

think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker  
the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script  
`alex , i'll take homicide for $400    ' 
libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life  
one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat  
libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared  
she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening  
nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband  
now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans  
if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further  
but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s  cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters  
during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen  
i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals  
most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production  
one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison  
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals )  
judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities  
while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant  
the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely  
and now , back to the plot  
while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice  
this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband

in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , "" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done  "" 
to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done  
sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter  
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous  
start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie  
the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers  
worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983  
meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother  
influential club dj julian dice , a  k  a  "" lucky 7 "" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star  
in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on "" the roller coaster of superstardom  "" 
in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom  
i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows    
you'll figure it out  
the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun  
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better  
what a mistake  
the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons  
instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes  
which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said  
mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face  
she actually looks scared during her one love scene  
but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse  
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb  
even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly "
-1,"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  
after the familiar 'a long time ago     ' 
opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  
however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park  ) 
they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters  
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent  
there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help  
there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod  
the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother  
there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen  
the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  
qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for  
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time  
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy  ) 
anakin is annoying and unlikeable  , 
instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  
it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him  
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while  
queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin  
again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here  
the actors don't help the movie much either  
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible "

wild wild west 
a better name for this movie might've been "" wild wild waste ""  
warner bros  , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad  
but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way  
they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer  
wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon  
if warner bros  had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is  
heck , ten times  
as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well  
here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair  
they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path  
as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess  
but the acting doesn't help either  
kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado  
smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib  
branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard  
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention  
her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass ""  
director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either  
even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost  
it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit  
last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable  
at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train  
he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion ! 
also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks  
last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! 
the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects  
the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show  
there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity  
i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible  
if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will "

-1,"the characters in jonathan lynn's "" the whole nine yards , "" yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999's "" analyze this "" and "" mickey blue eyes , "" 2000's "" gun shy "" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one-dimensional caricatures  
when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot  
in a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done  
unfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh-o-meter available , i'd guess that it briefly ascended around 2  5% of the time for me  
suffice to say , the comedy in "" the whole nine yards "" works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck  
nicholas "" oz "" oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec  
trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door  
walking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy "" the tulip "" tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison  
once getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz  
in her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy's whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy's wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage  
upon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz's dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside "" the tulip , "" and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill's dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself  
have you got all that ? 
because there is more  
much , much more  
and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures  
how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn's 1985 comedy classic , "" clue : the movie  "" 
going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble  
since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing "" comedy "" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value  
 "" the whole nine yards "" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill's shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark  
a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all  
on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis  
perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv's "" friends , "" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997's "" fools rush in "" to 1999's "" three to tango "" ) , and it has become a crushing bore  
meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy "" the tulip "" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background  
their three female counterparts fare noticeably better  
best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative "" species "" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia  
henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent  
amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy  
it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts  
finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time "

tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive  
this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail  
what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane  
when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior  
but even on it's own , u  s marshals is a pretty lousy movie  
while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time  
while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u  s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately  
to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not  
snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later  
tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge  
the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  
i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film  
there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing  
nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie  
downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife  
nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot  
the supporting cast are o  k , but when it comes to performances , u  s marshals falls flat on it's face  
it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either  
the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory  
as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional  
if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average  
and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie

the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well  
there are a couple of minor plot differences  
rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized  
the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original  
they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest  
and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out  
one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell  
over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie  
now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered  
there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense  
after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in  
still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? 
sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease  
this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a "" disease "" is never explained  
sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her

the movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time  
would that the stories were worth the telling  
earl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer  
bedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short  
his much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death  
having married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied  
earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to "" seduce and destroy , "" his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable  
meanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer  
not as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children  
the current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits  
on the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a "" somebody  "" 
his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish  
jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film  
grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c  reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection  
this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie  
and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs  
yes , frogs  
assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn't seem to faze the characters much  
oh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower didn't seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying )  
there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch  
mr  anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of "" historical "" occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing  
one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : "" we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us  "" 
this is an absolute lie  
god is in the forgiveness business  
in fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god's word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets  
 "" i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins  ""

-1,"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 )  
can you say    the 
third times not a charm ? 
plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week  
critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture  
when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign  
i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes  
when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign  
and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster  
it blows  
or as they say in french , "" eet blows ""  
could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? 
maybe  
could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? 
perhaps  
or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? 
naaaaaaah ! 
a bad movie is a bad movie  
on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in  
branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped  
smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others  
i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie  
then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage    huh    oh 
yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked  
little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 )  
he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career

expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible  
in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison  
watching glen or glenda ? 
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious  
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time  "" 
the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose  
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles  "" 
finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people  
  
  
all with their own thoughts

while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead

my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program  
true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon  
but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  
but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 
turns out i was right , mostly  
inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick  
at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany !

i don't see zany here

the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  
michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor  
oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town  
or , maybe all career politicians are like that  
i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  
he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget

a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged 
yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether  
scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy  
bill murray plays frank cross , a t  v executive with a horrible personality  
he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t  v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s  o  b he is , and he changes his way  
however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray  
frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean  
he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed  
however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either  
sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane  
whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away  
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly     )

the script is horrendous  
michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes

starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii  
rated r  
the legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast  
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named    
1900  
you heard right  
his name is , in all actuality , 1900  
he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman  
1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of "" visa matters  "" 
well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship  
one day , he discovers a grand piano  
he sits down and starts playing  
miraculously , what comes out is beautiful  
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age  
when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "" totally against regulations "" 1900 replies "" f * ck the regulations ! "" 
ho ho ho  
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land  
when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician  
his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet  
after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it  
how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask  
after that , 1900 and max become friends  
max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so  
what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! 
-- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record  
the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store  
the record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken

[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons  
they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation  
watching "" flubber "" really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy  
it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story  
the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere  
we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist  
within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is  
phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ? 
he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one )  
we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten  
sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has )  
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related  
christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too  
what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! 
wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day  
one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film  
the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter  
it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny  
unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing  
flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object  
most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along  
but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse  
all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air  
it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes  
during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , "" i think they might be cheating , "" to which the referee replies , "" there's no rules about jumping too high  "" 
 "" predictable "" doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point  
and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition  
not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears  
i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing "

before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok  
but the idea of doing a movie is insane  
it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all  
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  
yet it still fails  
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that  
the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe  
so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate  
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper )  
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in  
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves  
the acting is ok  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi  
however the film drags and is no fun  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made

ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year  
but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank  
no number of name changes can help this picture  
it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster  
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute  
the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises  
the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies  
from that moment on , it's all downhill  
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point  
it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured  
basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs  
there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions  
it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense  
the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around  
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion  
graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle  
unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it  
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition  
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc  -- over and over again  
the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length  
the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances  
there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash  
he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river  
a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers  
after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs  
as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives  
there isn't any real acting in this film

then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race  
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise  
considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably  
but it does  
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits  
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? 
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? 
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining  
almost  
the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter  
some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar  
a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin  
sound like something charlton heston might be in ? 
the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune ""  
the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with  
it's too loud  
it's too oppressive  
it's too slow "
-1,"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter  
these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen  
that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags  
observe the opening sequence  
a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips )  
they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles  
however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut  
he is undecided  
this happens for about 10 seconds  
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness  
the lights suddenly go out  
cisco is surprised and says : "" whoa    let's 
go ! "" 
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence  
the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film  
needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi  
however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss  
infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping  
during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution  
melvin must now find a way to stay alive  
by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ? 
cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing  
but , mr  nishi has a trace buster buster  
to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster  
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster  
and so on    
there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live "

-1,"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see  
therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas  
despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters  
a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there  
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust  
only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash  
the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments  
the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth  
governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses  
captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart  
pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time  
she even comes complete with insignificant best friend  
again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is  
this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work  
the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation  
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes  
the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch  
the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , "" colors of the wind  "" 
mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more  
the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character  
i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time  
even the children in the audience seemed restless  
while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed  
perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history  
it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled  
even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious  
as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film  
for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with "" savages , "" why did he so quickly change his previous "" kill as many indians as i can "" attitude  
if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this  
or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? 
i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway "
-1,"spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present  
he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town , where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he's rich and they're not  
he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result , the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it  
kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner , and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family's barn  
jasper's girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however , despite the fact that 1 ) it was her family's diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around , sulk , and smart off to the townspeople  
but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless , that's apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair )  
so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley , especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people )  
in the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam's favorite poem as well  
awwwww  
soon they're frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper's best friend ) see them together  
kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the town dance , drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper  
kelley runs off and decides to leave town  
sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him  
jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her , and sam , without even breaking stride basically says "" see ya ! "" 
and takes off to boston with kelley  
here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around , its completely worthless  
chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers , and it's because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place  
however , not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both  
i shouldn't have such feelings towards people i like , but their characters are so infuriating that    
well trust me , you'll feel the same way  
even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated  
he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it  
jasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley's provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions  
but , as in life , nice guys finish last  
for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film's only sympathetic character gets completely crushed  
then , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that )  
what , things weren't depressing enough for you mr  screenwriter ? 
who greenlit this project ? 
who "" on earth "" thought this would entertain anyone ? 
perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people  
but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them , and ruins one more for good measure "

so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe  
the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde )  
early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore  
they agree to give him a ride to the next village  
he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe  
very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo  
we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake  
she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course  
our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard  
no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell  
our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp  
enjoy ! 
so much for the first attempt to catch her  
but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? 
our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake  
too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition  
one by one she goes after the others  
eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure  
the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned  
however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring  
whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh  
the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster  
her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down  
mostly we don't see the act of devouring  
but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part  
whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes  
maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real  
the animatronics are somewhat more believable  
but that didn't work for the strangling scenes  
don't go see the movie for the f/x  
they are everything but up-to-date "
-1,"when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right  
predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years  
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater  
am i enjoying myself ? 
is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 
this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week  
so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review  
daily news ? 
negative  
reelviews ? 
negative  
epinions  com ? 
negative  
this was nothing new  
american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures  
same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded  
since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr  , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again  
but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive  
i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years  
but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls  
whoops  
boys and girls is about a "" nerdy , smart "" boy named ryan ( prinze jr  ) and a "" popular , flirt "" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani )  
briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends  
but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other  
with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship  
the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found  
i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons  
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to  
it is almost offensive

-1,"i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy  
it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless  
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999  
in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing  
more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship  
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant  
in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage  
it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years  
convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly  
anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will  
jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p  m  on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child  
there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends  
it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters  
at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist  
screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs  
from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees  
it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development  
by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless  
and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness  
there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake  
the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged  
and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation  
the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion  
i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks  
far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church  
you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem  
nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to  
the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity "

-1,"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie  
a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage  
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid  
godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close  
there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly  
frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning  
there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
 ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse  
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking  
independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action  
in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking  
actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him  
the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply  
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple  
he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway  
in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams

--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested  
an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him  
for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered  
when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  
they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm  
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  
the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  
during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled  
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  
in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  
after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's  
because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered  
if there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty  
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  
if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  
compelling , but ultimately not  
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images  
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence  
when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv  
at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  
at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing )  
for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance  
one over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  
why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of "" rednecks "" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? 
and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? 
i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment  
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence  
the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated  
a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken "

the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire  
we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology  
as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out  
there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all  
i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film  
once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence  
rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon  
not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing 
for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined  
however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis  
yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht  
okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up  
projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up  
before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere  
this is just as well  
the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them  
they're either silly , sappy , or both  
the dialog gets much of the credit for this  
an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle  "" 
not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on  "" 
my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil  
her response is , "" they have weapons and technology  
we just have love  "" 
suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen  
which it does  
the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing  
please note that it is the action that is unexpected "

sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? 
it's actually an improvement over the real thing  
the acting is just plain awful  
i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting  
jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes  
compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies  
added to the sound problems was the cinematography  
this film was filled with beautiful african scenery  
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me  
quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment  
then we have the special effects  
 "" special effects in a tarzan movie ? "" 
you are no doubt asking yourself ? 
yes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story  
probably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story  
in most parts , they weren't bad , just nothing special  
but , they were more than a little on the hokey side  
except of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie  
the grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that point  
it almost looked like they had run out of money  
these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production "

-1,"the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that's the problem  
the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it  
 "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance  
it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun  
it wasn't always this way  
tim burton's "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge  
the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel  
batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night  
the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent  
batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline  
those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck  
 "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness  
the blame lies with director joel schumacher  
a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes  
unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do  
 "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who  
while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti  
a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film  
 "" batman and robin "" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions  
it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one  
ironically , the parts of "" batman and robin "" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne  
easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at  
the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father  
as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl  
in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling  
i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight  
of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where "" batman and robin "" really suffers  
as mr  freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion  
laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act "
-1,
-1,"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start  
recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  
a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e  l  e  ) that wiped out the dinosaurs  
what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world  
firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  
to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much )  
mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted  
 ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment'  ) 
it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  
however , the film simply fails on that note  
the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials  
she's still making good money though  
t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast  
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  
robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all )  
leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  
warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway )  
plot holes , plot holes , plot holes  
now , e  l  e  
is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? 
where's the logic ? 
leder could have at least made it plausible with 20  
and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims  
the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing  
i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start  
it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter  
building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr "
-1,"instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching ""  
i have a name for it myself : "" gross ""  
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too  
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ? 
this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence  
instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa  
he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him  
after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's "" psychotics ward ""  
assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr  )  
caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career  
of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison  
and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor  
he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell  
let's get one thing straight : dr  theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off  
any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way  
not good old theo  
no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now  "" 
this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems  
director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs  
it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction )  
it aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts  
as yoda would say , inspire it does not  
it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story  
indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character  
this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence  
i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation  
i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever  
oscar winner cuba gooding jr  on the other hand is dreadful "
-1,
-1,"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  
the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review  
that's not a good sign  
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him  
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment )  
bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! )  
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a  fox ) , who have never met  
to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex  
first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them  
oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin  
back to the store  
now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay  
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 
nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too  
talk about coitus interruptus  
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies  
the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
at the extreme  
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  
it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting  
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) 
does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  
for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise  
however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery  
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  
if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung-fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective  
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable  
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? 
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? 
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? 
these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward "

-1,"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival  
on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  
they need not have wasted their time  
the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor  
there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click  
i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either  
keep cool just isn't very funny  
the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  
although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost  
too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh  
qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments  
however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade  
it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film  
you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  
at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving  
cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  
although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying  
headache , as i said  
the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying )  
they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship  
the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back  
of course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit  
in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  
we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced  
there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses  
there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character  
the bookseller would be better off without her  
although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man  
while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation "

rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language  
starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne  
running time : 132 minutes 
we go into a movie theater , boom ! 
the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on  
we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is  
why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into  
again like this past summers hit "" stigmata "" , "" end of days "" may be worse  
it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some "" rosemary's baby "" , along with "" the devil's advocate "" a little "" exorcist "" and some "" stigmata "" here and there  
whala you have "" end of days "" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific  
sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers  
the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next  
jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist  
he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes  
he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie  
that's pretty much it on plot  
it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went  
as for arnie ? 
good role , ok performance  
i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts  
the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film  
in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions  
gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in "" stigmata "" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character  
two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun "" the devil's advocate "" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also  
robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child  
of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new  
the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in "" stigmata ""  
here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie  
the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home  
only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well  
the sad thing is that "" end of days "" had so many things going for it  
the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing "
-1," "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be  
almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence )  
crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous  
 "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters  
it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation  
by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed  
john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp  
of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy  
while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked  
to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket  
desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation  
lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation  
he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl  
what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness  
press junkets are a haven for control freaks  
studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand  
generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel  
the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews  
every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things  
the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets  
representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions  
they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges  
the "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs  
placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit  
the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas  
for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press  
when they do deal with journalists , the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed  
gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions  
lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids  
is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? 
hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie "

-1,"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" 
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece  
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  
and i was impressed  
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie  
it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs  
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do  
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont  
wow  
isn't that a memorable name ? 
i could just say it over and over again  
sebastian valmont  
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach  
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips  
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist  
the ones who do are irritating  
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants  
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn  
but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty  "" 
so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here )  
but -- dear god ! 
-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting  
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting  
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  
she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons  
gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive  
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  
but i can't forget mr "
-1,"about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! "" 
at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like  
when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark  
every year , a couple films like this are released  
you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  
this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain  
 "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements  
and you thought "" the saint "" was bad  
 "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule  
well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi    or 
is he ? 
after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  
and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  
the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever  
soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him  
there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  
the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue  
sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  
the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one  
it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances  
the script of "" the jackal "" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on  
is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? 
is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? 
or is it a combination of both ? 
 "" the jackal "" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character  
the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast  
the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then  
the supporting characters are worse  
sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable  
what is poitier doing here ? 
he's one of the best living actors ! 
does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? 
diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade  
it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do  
the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time  
the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain "
-1,"in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don't cut it  
sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess  
for those who remember disney's fantastic "" adventures of ichabod crane "" , it is actually superior to this  
disney's version was at least interesting , while burton's film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights  
while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off  
ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders  
the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman  
now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow  
sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster  
in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable  
no one could stop him , not even ichabod  
by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought  
burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes  
he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails  
another pathetic element of the film was the script  
like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims  
he completely butchered the story to pieces  
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked  
the acting by depp was quite notable  
he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner  
if it wasn't for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy  
just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this  
it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster  
it's too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush  
the atmosphere too was quite involving  
i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on  
at least burton's films are eye candy , even if they are trash  
the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien  
other than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery  
by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed "
-1,"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing  
partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr  
as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world  
thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985  
now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  
in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  
meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter  
she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break  
of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  
he didn't  
right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  
the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
the script , however , is painfully bad  
it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl  "" 
i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? 
why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? 
why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? 
why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? 
okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll  
broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  
hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  
like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color  
what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  
casting must have been asleep on this one  
the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past  
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  
the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it "

-1,"midway through "" anaconda "" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says "" i thought this movie would be my first big break  
instead , it's turned into a disaster  "" 
truer words have never been spoken  
 "" anaconda "" is a monster movie with a lousy monster  
it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable  
it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box  
as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens  
the main difference between the giant snake in "" anaconda "" and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic  
 "" anaconda "" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years  
animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world  
but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame  
in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air  
the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper  
here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon  
what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie  
but enough about the phony snakes  
now it's time to talk about the lousy story  
heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest  
stoltz tells his crew "" pray that you didn't forget your bug spray  "" 
apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect  
along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama  
within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness  
from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from "" jaws "" and "" dead calm  "" 
one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz  
early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious  
so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? 
also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? 
ah , the mysteries of hollywood  
the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen  
jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters  
lopez , who starred in "" selena , "" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible  
ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously "

-1,"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take  
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2  
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals  
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy  
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute  
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition  
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig  
that'll do  "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script )  
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget )  
out  
e  g  
daily comes in with noticable results  
 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 )  
 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_  
babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again  
 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired )  
season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin

-1,"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire  
usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein  
to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat  
but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you  
by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors  
not in these times  
all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade  
without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity  
which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half  
not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower  
with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims  
you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains  
blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual  
the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost  
it's all hokum and nonsense , of course  
but the filmmakers play it straight  
unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings  
you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter  
another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero  
also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs  
he must also be proficient in the martial arts  
why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me  
 ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings  ) 
wesley snipes is buff as blade  
he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey  
blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill  
this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face  
today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee  
they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes  
they are more farcical than frightful "
-1,"come on hollywood , surprise me  
stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset  
the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls  
personal , because his niece is one of the victims  
it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist  
freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl  
we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to "" dominate "" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem  
anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to    well , 
you know the rest  
a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story  
perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue  
so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? 
and as for comparisons to seven    oh 
please ! 
kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass  
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here  
one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting  
two , the script has no sense of humour  
three , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea  
thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story  
we can't feel her rage  
some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register  
and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this  
for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying  
young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead  
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? 
not much , and you can hardly blame him  
there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling  
but the script is beyond rescue "

 "" dad couldn't listen  
and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me  "" 
paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms  
as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up  
benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role  
roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems  
when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out  
if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium  
so it is with paulie  
when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars  
too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again  
tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u  s  he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study  
although misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i'm russian  
i like long stories  "" ) , 
his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy  
besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg  
naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart  
the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half  
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills  
when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring  
tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball  
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation  
it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals  
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes

now my view has completely changed  
it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride  
the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention  
they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs )  
of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves  
thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians  
the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse  
i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny  
all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series  
one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series  
creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death  
a person can only take so much  
we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it  
it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful  
it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful  
speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well  
sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked  
it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage  
it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is  
alan rickman however was not so lucky  
after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess  
it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away  
when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up  
like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results

assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you're already ahead of the game

how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?

leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante  
i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points  
he's concerned about buddy jason gedrick's heroin abuse  
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin's character's sister  
he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch )  
but none of this ever really amounts to anything  
it seems that moresco's greater concern is to provide that intangible "" slice of life "" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone's been trying to evoke since scorsese's early work  
so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other  
 ( do people actually do this ! ? ) 
we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not  
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose  
bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you've seen in movies just like this one before  
assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it's almost funny  
moresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal  
as a result , the movie's style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down  
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us  
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past  
moresco needs to either trust his audience's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it  
his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety  
if he actually gets that chance

-1,"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes 
director : luis mandoki 
screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) 
cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage  
review by : geoff berkshire 
i'm not an overly cynical guy  
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years  
however , i have my limits and i also have standards  
this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day  
the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james )  
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean  
the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her  
upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it )  
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down  
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing  
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship  
of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love )  
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened  
the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film  
there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending  
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel  
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since    
well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 )  
message in a bottle is one slow moving film  
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this  
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work  
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly  
costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring  
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry  
the supporting players are given very little to do  
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted  
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film "
-1,"there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do  
i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda  
something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob  
deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test  
sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait    excuse 
me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion  
there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold  
as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients  
a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits  
and up go the lights  
it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream  
here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j  o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic  
writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously  
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes  
case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda  
in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive  
he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable  
in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive  
he looks at another character    and 
winks  
make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing  
it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun  
i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies  
you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing  
just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point "
-1,"plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive  
they get into an accident  
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares  
what's the deal ? 
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out    
critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package  
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly  
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly  
so what are the problems with the movie ? 
well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled  
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on  
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained  
now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem  
it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes  
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? 
not really  
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining  
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding  
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! 
okay , we get it    there 
are people chasing her and we don't know who they are  
do we really need to see it over and over again ? 
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? 
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows  
there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense  
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood  
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling  
overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it  
oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick    it's 
just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids "

-1,"when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games  
why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? 
the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw  
this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack  
the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the "" outworld "" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity  
the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined  
here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation  
how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , "" i knew love would keep us together , "" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh  
there are some seriously stupid things in this movie  
take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the "" inner winds "" , generated by earth's magma flows  
you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast  
how fast ? 
as katana says , "" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all  "" 
what ? 
later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn "" red "" williams , otherwise known as "" saber "" on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu  
how do we know this is where she went ? 
there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii  
remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign  
i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are  
there's a lot of major flipping action , too  
the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another  
do they land and immediately get into the fighting ? 
does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? 
do they collide in mid-air ? 
no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away  
why did they need those metal balls to travel ? 
everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b  
i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics  
the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly  
 "" ouch "" was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one  
you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next  
it seems that's all there is in this movie  
maybe it is  
as i had mentioned , the acting is bad  
there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny  
after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , "" you look good in mud  
no , really , you do  "" 
remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang "
-1," "" easely one of the worst films of the year   "" 
with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  
the result is somewhat predictable  
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry  
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture  
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug  
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it   satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold  
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc  
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him  
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  
no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )  
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn  
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ?  
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution  
he is walking around n  y  , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius  
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special  
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter  
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back   i 
can give you happiness that you can only dream of "

-1,"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer  
unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge  
he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one  
he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot  
the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia  
adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits  
robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar  
however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall  
she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave )  
so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding  
as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one  
to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia  
from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae  
and then there's the music    
learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow  
as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols  
2 , 3 , and 4 ! 
while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot  
at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person  
here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him  
barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia  
which leaves us with adam sandler  
he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception )  
when he's in full nice-guy mode , he's more pathetic than endearing  
the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz )  
but none of them work well at all  
buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous  
lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny  
the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film's finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works "
-1,"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion  
but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned  
however , protocol forces me to do otherwise  
soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent  
party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley )  
matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck )  
driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash  
sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her  
as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him  
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party  
annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions  
she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself  
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material  
in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion  
when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d  
carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation  
we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 
and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here  
carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness  
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around  
the second lamest device , of course , is the , "" oh , it was all a dream "" resolution  
and guess what ? 
this movie has both ! 
not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile  
since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere  
that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples  
carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it  
[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats  
-ed  ] 
when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts  
and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed  
regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity  
why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? 
why would they shower in their clothes ? 
what if they weren't covered in latex paint ? 
the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes "

do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence  "

-1,"the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into "" heartbreakers  "" 
ray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office  
while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , "" just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! "" 
i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , "" geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? "" 
over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind "" heartbreakers "" predated "" three's company  "" 
suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s  
all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv  
while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special  
women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts  
on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about "" booze and broads "" and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers  
the adults laughed and laughed  
 "" heartbreakers "" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated  
in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft  
i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project  
perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s  
if so , they were sadly mistaken  
the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team  
it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator  
having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night  
the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary  
just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them  
the "" horrified "" bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way  
of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up  
the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes  
in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam  
their mark this time is william b  tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking  
max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune  
complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart  
as if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind  
the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior "" a fish called wanda  ""

-1,"there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description  
the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through  
presumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off  
movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence  
 "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny  
unfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs  
unfortunately , there are no laughs  
the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence  
instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "" boogie nights  "" 
however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market  
wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed )  
the movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him  "" 
the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money  
his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst  
melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine )  
one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom  
however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter  
so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it  
not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper  
of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin  
along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by "" jurassic park , "" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen )  
what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises  
not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "" king kong lives , "" which is two weeks overdue  
this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( "" face/off "" ) , who also served as executive producer  
woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films  
wong , who directed such films as "" rock'n'roll cop "" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy  
maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them  
many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey  
in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue  
what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is "" it's all love "" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant "
-1,"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction  
the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel  
so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel  
congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better  
it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good  
the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l  jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting  
several years ago dr  norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered  
the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien  
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s  
suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft  
included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber )  
together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets  
one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship  
what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances  
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects  
the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film  
it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen  
the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting  
that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film  
but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster  
it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't  
hoffman's acting seems muted  
jackson seems to laid back  
we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads  
levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance  
and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess  a 
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price "

-1,"stars : armand assante ( mike hammer ) , barbara carrera ( dr  
charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : 
in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel "" i , the jury , "" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in "" miami vice "" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol  
however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim  
beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" )  
after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic  
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles  
for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss  
and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic  
 "" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code  
although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book  
rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women  
it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself  
no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling  
it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor  
 "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made  
the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it's alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 )  
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget  
he was quickly replaced by richard t  heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects  
heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently  
it shows in the final product  
cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none  
he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull  
the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth  
but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical  
the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties  
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona "
-1,"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own  
not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d  wood jr  has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time  
of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent  
boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" )  
boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent  
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 )  
his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste  
if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion  
unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around  
 "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's  
his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot  
but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling  
the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found  
in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions  
it's more middle ages than space age  
the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life  
these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society  
however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years  
if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals  
one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed  
like "" the wizard of oz , "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head  
 ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come  ) 
calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources  
from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , "" the gun is good  
the penis is evil  "" 
that line alone is worth the movie's cult following  
one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex  
once there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them "
-1,"i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days  
for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another  
such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures  
the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps  
the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places  
sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time  
janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons )  
with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers  
with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker  
but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated    
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy  
then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes  
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 
the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene  
pure and simple , the klumps is a failure  
its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes  
any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process  
it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash  
hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes  
the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema  
everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough  
the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts  
the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings  
the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone  
the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood  
sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to  
but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy  
the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct  
and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time "
-1,"as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother  
yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face  
this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched  
 ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat  
and she's right , it is that bad  ) 
directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best  
boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts  
amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more  
but who's counting ? 
and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic  
meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad  
it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything  
herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes "" your geyser's a geezer , "" and "" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack  "" 
as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as "" a walking kodak moment , "" are celebrating their 18th birthday  
as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski  
as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men  
as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire  
their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers  
the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week  
hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material  
this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in  
steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances  
the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey  
even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull  
to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog  
put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said  
although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road  
they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt  
 "" how could this possibly be worst , "" asks phil  
just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill  
its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag "
-1,
-1,"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars  "" 
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind  
but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e  t  
the extra-terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens  "" 
why ? 
because there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars  "" 
all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films )  
if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film  
of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time  
 "" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time  
the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet  
luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians  
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" )  
a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride  
after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel  
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home  
after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth  
 "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film  
that's it  
everything else fails  
the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script  
only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life  
a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes  
take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way  
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? 
why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? 
shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? 
why are the characters such idiots ? 
because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them  
all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ? 
can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? 
the whole film is like that  
the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time  
sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : "" look , there's mars "" astronaut b : "" you sure that's mars ? "" 
astronaut a : "" yeah , that's mars all right  "" 
astronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "" 
that exchange isn't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were  
for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell "
-1,"not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie  
earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable "" comedies "" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves  
ick    real 
sweet stuff  
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth  
i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a "" cheese "" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time  
yipes    another 
beauty  
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? 
uhhhm , you guessed it    not 
much  
plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery  
but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise  
critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture  
for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a "" sluttier "" version of her character of phoebe on tv's "" friends ""  
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close  
thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut  
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast  
foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie  
and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong  
he didn't fit the part  
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role  
a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave "" je ne sais quoi ""  
in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good  
we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting "
-1,"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  
why ? 
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey'  
i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon'  
but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster  
this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  
you have been warned  
of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  
when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally )  
of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' )     
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  
that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole  
sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  
the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 )  
after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction  
for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art  
the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  
immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars  
let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there  
it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months  
i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia  
instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship  
what happened during the five months prior to this ? 
did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? 
still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak  
depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? 
c'mon )

starring bruce willis , billy bob thornton , liv tyler , ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j  j  
abrams directed by michael bay 
it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur  ) 
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller ? 
they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) 
harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck )  
once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic  
 "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack  
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen  
 ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain  ) 
whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "" 
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework  
it has a vivid soundmix "

-1,"in my review of "" the spy who shagged me , "" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore  
the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing  
 "" scream 3 "" provides the latest proof of this rule  
in los angeles production has begun on "" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , "" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell )  
however , life soon starts imitating art , and "" stab "" cast members turn up stabbed  
smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3  "" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name  
  
  
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice  
the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy  
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with  
indeed , "" scream 3 "" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original "" scream  "" 
at the scene of each murder in "" scream 3 , "" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer  
to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films  
 ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is )  
unlike its predecessors , "" scream 3 "" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer  
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is  
the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? 
the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? 
the driven young director ( scott foley ) ? 
the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? 
the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random  
wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen  
the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious  
possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche  
i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first "" scream "" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home  
at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas  
 "" scream 3 "" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles  
look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from "" seinfeld "" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point  
all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- "" scream "" job search  
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying "" the blair witch project "" 's web strategy  
 "" scream 3 "" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie

it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow

maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and

because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall

-1,"i cried during _babe_  
i admit it  
the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children's film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental  
such , my friend , is the power of cinema  
when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations  
they can't possibly drop the ball on this one  
can't miss  
can't possibly miss  
they missed  
what went wrong ? 
after much thought , i supply three general rules  
 ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i  e  , penny marshall's dreadful "" preacher's wife "" )  
betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here  
it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b  
take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show  
 ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i  e  , 
 "" con air "" )  
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time  
it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits  
now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy  
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle  
but there's little humor here  
that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig  
even the mouth is ill-synched  
 ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script  
there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy  
to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty  
this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have "

-1,"everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country )  
but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure  
i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co  
as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director  
 ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) 
for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth  
six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly  
but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing "" amadeus "" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed  
the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race  
 ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world  ) 
every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment  
he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western  
 ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers  ) 
he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version  
that's no excuse-someone generated this footage  
muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia  
consider such curiosities    
picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ? 
 "" don't ask  "" 
worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt  
most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? 
the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax  
 ( and if you've seen return of the jedi , you've seen the ending of this movie  ) 
didn't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? 
frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists  
 ( take a look at the painful "" troi gets drunk "" scene in fc and you'll get the general idea of insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone  ) 
even the worst shatner and co  
treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones  
neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge  
and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise's answer to urkel  
need a cheap laugh ? 
have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really is  
here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data "
-1,"ugh  that about sums this movie up  
just , ugh  
the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence  
and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of    how to put this ?    
dignity ? 
not quite the word i'm looking for  
you understand , right ? 
and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever'  
leave it to america to screw the whole thing up  
>from the 'geniuses' that brought us "" independece day "" , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had  
while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline  
summing up the movie is simple  
heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  
simple as that  
matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show "" mad about you ""  
the dialogue seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all  
i can see the scene on the set right now  
 "" all right ! 
we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's going to bomb in our faces

the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well-done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind )

and drag it out they do ! !

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either "

-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored  
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is )  
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  
cruise grins a little too slyly  
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film  
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1  
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's )  
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! "" 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug  
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture )  
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand "

wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor  
most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? 
perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle    
but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements  
the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success  
a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor'  
o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger )  
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage  
the problem is that his proposal sucks  
big time  
you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach  
and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens  
jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative )  
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie  
of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years  
the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day  
with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with    
and within a very limited time frame  
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor'  
for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ?  
another is the colorful cast  
o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity "

for claudia  
he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn  
should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown    or 
should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again  
part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man    and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return  
now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes  
at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre  
unfortunately , it seems much much longer  
the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious  
edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame  
there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked  
he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons   "

unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie  
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie  
not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video  
it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house  
but no one has arrived yet  
her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups  
some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers  
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end  
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues  
it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms  
first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof  
he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production  
bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them  
they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections  
he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school  
his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch  
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy  
moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts  
val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene  
on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find  
paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds  
of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot  
wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless  
paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship  
however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening  
finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film  
jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before  
while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy "

it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin  
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol  
the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas  
but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message  
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia  
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply  
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country  
everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war  
the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never  
there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether  
the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide  
the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined  
he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage  
the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless  
she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick )  
what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her  
even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures  
her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing  
since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use  
the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff  
for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie )  
the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation  
the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail  
it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail  
the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity  
the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity  
things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood  
there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded  
this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute "
-1,"to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this  
a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay  
also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending  
not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews  
so much for truth in advertising  
roland emmerich , who's later "" independence day "" would look like "" the 400 blows "" compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens  
in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it  
it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out  
they're decipherer ? 
a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr  dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word  
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 
so there is a hokey ending ! 
duh ! 
he figures it out in about a minute  
yea  
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , "" jack "" o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position )  
why a suicidal colonel ? 
for the ending ! 
you'll get the hang of this  
they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad  
after an overdone special effects thing , they're    inside a goddam pyramid  
so they went to egypt , right ? 
wrong  
they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt  
they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people  
yea  
also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language  
an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( "" say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "" 
- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development  
by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the "" outer limits "" or something  
the script's terrible  
the special effects are okay , but nothing great  
the story's so weak that it's almost opaque  
the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a "" full house "" marathon "

you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight  
surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting  
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue  
it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word  
though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore  
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such "" classics "" as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls  
the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits  
i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad  
it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money  
our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual  
he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone  
for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? )  
he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for  
i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short  
the subject and the style seem to have been made for it  
unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome  
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary  
it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is  
i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me  
unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around  
there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so "" good "" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one  
whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case , this is a failure  
jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos  
ricci , for example , plays a prostitute  
her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out  
thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff  
was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? 
zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up  
lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature  
the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production "

american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting ; instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate , they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives  
jim ( jason biggs ) is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance , oz ( chris klein ) is still the sweetest guy on the block , having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying-abroad girlfriend , stifler ( seann william scott ) is still a horny stoner , kevin ( thomas ian nichols ) still has no personality and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) still longs for stifler's mom  
have i missed anyone ? 
so , obviously , not much has changed  
this is not a problem , provided that the movie boasts the rapid-fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original  
but american pie 2 is the very definition of "" sequelitis  "" 
it's coarser , yes , and it pushes the envelope even more , but its heart isn't in it  
it's easy cash to capitalize off the first film's success , but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original  
part of the reason why the film doesn't work , i think , is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  
here , everything has been cheapened  
they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ; they have no motivation except for sex , sex , beer and sex  
that's not to say that you can't make a decent comedy from that premise , but it is one of american pie 2's undoings  
missing , too , is the sweetness that permeated american pie , the this-could-be-you quality of the main players  
here , the characters are too aware of themselves as pop-culture icons , and they're even more one-note  
stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim , oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self-discoveries at arbitrary moments , none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see  
and then there's the soon-to-be-notorious scene where jim superglues "" himself to himself , "" which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film's ailments , one that also permeated say it isn't so , director j  b  rodgers' debut  
there's a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation , and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it  
it's hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them  
i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie  
if there's one redeeming factor to american pie 2 , it's the inimitable eugene levy as jim's dad , who pops in on jim as he's about to score and utters lines like "" your mother and i have been known to get frisky "

-1,"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant  
with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay  
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored  
in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider  
demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world  
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2  i can't remember seeing a character quite like her  
after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety  
what a woman ! 
lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film  
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife  
there is little insight into her character  
she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house  
juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms  lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it  
both women were anything but sexy or attractive  
poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems  
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something  
for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene  
fine  
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite  
fine  
what does jack proceed to do ? 
he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss  
why ? 
the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite  
i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral "

-1,"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  
hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  
time passes  
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc    
this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla  
now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil  
and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly  
john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point  
all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners  
and then there's martin sheen  
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years  
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent  
as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot  
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street  
i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape "
-1,"in "" the 13th warrior , "" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king's old lady  
with his translator ( screen legend omar sharif in a small role ) , ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen ( vikings )  
he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king  
a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance  
a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider  
thus , ahmed becomes the "" 13th warrior  "" 
on the trip , ahmed manages to learn the vikings' language by listening to their fireside conversations  
a bit far-fetched , it's true , but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting  
ahmed , who's called "" ibn "" by the vikings , forms friendships with herger the joyous ( dennis storh ? i ) and the viking leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich )  
when they arrive in the other kingdom , the thirteen warriors discover that they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves  
hereafter , most of the movie is battle scenes : the cannibals attack the vikings , the vikings attack the cannibals , the cannibals attack the  
  
  
well , you get the idea  
just to add some action , there's also a viking vs  viking duel  
other movies insert scenes between the fights ; these scenes are called character development  
i suspect that "" the 13th warrior "" had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team direction  
the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan ( you'll notice a lot of similarities between "" warrior "" and mctiernan's "" predator , "" including the chittering jungle sounds )  
somewhere along the line , mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over  
crichton , whose novel "" eaters of the dead "" is the basis for "" warrior , "" has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction "" thrillers "" : "" westworld , "" "" coma , "" "" looker , "" "" runaway  "" 
their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie  
perhaps what "" the 13th warrior "" needs more than anything else is a villain  
the "" eaters of the dead "" are a faceless mob in blackface  
they have no personality , and by the end they don't even seem particularly threatening  
the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression  
mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain ; it was his "" die hard "" that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil roles in action films  
 "" the 13th warrior "" suffers from a lack of vision  
it wants to be "" predator "" meets "" braveheart "" meets "" the magnificent seven "" meets "" dances with wolves  "" 
with so many competing goals , all it can do is echo what it might have been "

the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job  
six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight  
she soon bumps into j  t  barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen

schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery  
this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son  
just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in  * 
contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them  
leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins  
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in  
karen's initial encounter with j  t  during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility  
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment  
small world , eh ? 
then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage  
however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day  
but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne  
there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character  
karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material  
schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture

it occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill  "" 
it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? 
chances are , there * is * truth in advertising  
too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow  "" 
that and "" dogma "" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule  
an hour of "" angel "" or "" buffy "" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face  
i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween  
at least i would have been forgiving  
hey , tis the season  
the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like "" scream , "" "" halloween , "" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical  
hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand  
  
  
well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago  
riiiiight  
y'know , that just sends chills down my spine  
yeah  
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil  
ooooooo  
hint : blood and guts only work a few times  
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that  
there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable "" plot developments "" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare  
each was more predictable than the last  
why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? 
sheesh  
was i grossed out ? 
yes "

-1,"a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline  
howard pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers )  
after a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon  
jeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age  
he incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive  
he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence  
things change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch  
he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room  
by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting  
when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv  
realizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth  
but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him  
as a result , he goes to the police to report her missing  
while with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone  
his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion  
but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home  
there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder  
the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room  
in jail , things look bad for him  
no one believes him , including his friends and lawyer  
his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird  
out on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife  
through a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort  
once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story  
the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance  
he is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil  
it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation  
a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd  
the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop  
it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw "

-1,"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right ""  
a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" )  
for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween  
urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special  
for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh ""  
alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention  
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it  
it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt  
the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them  
unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering  
if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla  
but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced )  
allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation  
these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? 
sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while  
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three  
despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes  
as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer  
you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface  
all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected  
all the better for that elusive crazed killer  
coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task  
but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity  
this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise  
it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques  
it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack  
i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing  
yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room  
i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer  
apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers  
in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity "
-1,"where do i begin ? 
okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time  
in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years    
or even a decade  
this is bad beyond belief  
i would * not * suggest paying money to see this  
there's a good chance you'll regret it  
if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out  
go right ahead  
the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of    buenos aires  
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life  
before long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined  
they train  
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever  
after an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs  
the big bugs look nice , even though their design is only "" okay  "" 
unfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway  
cue more agony  
then some characters have sex  
then some more die  
 * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * 
cue more agony  
the movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home  
unfortunately , after that torture , they can't think straight , don't pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks  
you remember how batman & robin was bad ? 
well , batman & robin kicked this movie's sorry butt , people  
starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie  
it does not succeed as a drama "

-1,"one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain  
 "" so , are we all going to die ? "" 
the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town  
the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough  
and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so  
populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors  
one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture  
besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie  
graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines  
director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening  
the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr  's dark and ugly cinematography  
the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water  
onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie  
christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom  
edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie  
coming to their "" rescue "" is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman  
he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan  
the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom  
along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver  
the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest  
they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake  
christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness  
the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town  
the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns  
the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly  
when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees  
counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other  
the show has a single , but unprintable , good line  
betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter  
the show concludes with a sickening set of twists "

brit love story in the offing  
effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite  
he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making  
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school  
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas  
in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music  
karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company  
chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about  
if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo    , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat  
kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much    
a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy  
personally , give me those cheap laughs any day  
i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story  
different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it  
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself  
lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple  
but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like  
prentice does though , and that's never explained  
but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up  
if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either  
snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance  
misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance  
the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment "

-1,"there was probably a good reason that the warner bros  studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened  
and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why  
this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago  
fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky  
it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role )  
it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit  
seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa  
no    not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa  
it's the environmental protection agency  
i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! 
taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice  
written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks  
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in  
seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket  
but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free  
that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches  
slow and plodding , this project is a total mess  
the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige  
here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness  
townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued  
fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever  
and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes  
the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment  
but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal  
kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away  
seagal gallantly replies : "" i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth  "" 
i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background "

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing    
is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
nothing is not more  
it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! !  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you  
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  
i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water  
there must be some other reason  
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction  ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost  
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 
over and over  
this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    
and argue with each other  
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! ""  
and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear

-1,"nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- "" frankenweenie , "" "" beetlejuice , "" "" batman , "" "" edward scissorhands , "" "" ed wood , "" "" mars attacks ! "" 
-- yet none of them have been horror films  
 "" sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people  
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this  
i left disappointed  
andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow  "" 
in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors  
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders  
several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman  
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning  
he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret  
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering )  
my reaction : ho-hum  
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting  
that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages  
however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy  
it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal  
along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series  
a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman  
  
  
well , he's a guy without a head  
  
  
on a horse ( boo ! )  
the performances are also awful  
although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent  
ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character  
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish  
the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken  
i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only "" bram stoker's dracula "" and "" mary shelley's frankenstein "
-1," "" alcohol and drugs = bad  
not alcohol and drugs = good  
got it ? "" 
just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself'   
'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings  
gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol  
for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end  
this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself  
her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes  
such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house  
this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab  
here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment  
most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party  
the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times  
it is a classic cautionary tale  
an echo  
a big , fat and expensive clich ?  
a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting'  
director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review  
for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy  
jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness  
and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean  
isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? 
even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park  betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11  
it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously  
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance  
that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story  
 "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr  cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century  
and that's how simple it is ! 
in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' "

-1,"roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards "

plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs  tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college  
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman  
critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks  
this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a  fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles  
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr  
zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate  
he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue  
sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs  tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! )  
all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend  
no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater  
if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning  
little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman  
kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7  5/10 )  
he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's "" dawson's creek "" , a show kevin created  
he was once an aspiring actor  
in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's "" another world ""  
also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs  tingle , which is also loosely based on the book "" killing mr  griffin "" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 "

-1,"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball  
fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him  
there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind  
the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars  
the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13  
interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey  
instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart  
mission to mars takes it's first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done  
during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife  
it's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety  
the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability  
there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time  
maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects  
it's the year 2020 and this is nasa's first manned excursion to the red planet  
a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results  
graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth  
in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell )  
obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them  
i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them  
time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the crew didn't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable  
 ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew's mission and life is in mortal danger  
on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link  
women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character's personality trait  ) 
by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush  
there is an adage in film to "" show , don't tell  "" 
mission to mars does both  
repeatedly  
characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them  
the film's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying  
as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film "
-1,"my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free  
as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book  
 ( "" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks  "" ) 
languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending  
since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery  
other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture  
with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host  
he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant  
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project  
surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there  
perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success  
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone  
the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day  
this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible  
sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan )  
after throwing out constant one-liners ( "" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car  "" ) , 
sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket  
and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs  
 ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever  ) 
after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie  
we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die  
to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers  
let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie  
my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37  
it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up  
my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it  
matthew pointed out that it "" is not as good as it could have been or should have been  "" 
 ( amen  ) 
he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle  
jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was "

-1,"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw )  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan )  
they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano )  
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans  
on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties  
sounds great huh , well it's not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didn't work in this movie ? 
that would be the rest of it  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road  
it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless  
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in  
i like wrestling  
i watch it at home and laugh  
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it "

-1,"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today  
basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers  
how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture  
swordfish is loud , violent and amoral  
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life  
and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? 
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists  
swordfish is a very cynical movie  
it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration  
the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is  
this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions  
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign  
talk about whacked-out patriotism  
my objections to swordfish are many  
the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort  
it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits  
another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife  
stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl  
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films  
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve  
in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed  
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel  
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films  
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well  
yea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it  
travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel  
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off  
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings  
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database  
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate  
halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel "

a big star , catherine zeta-jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6  5/10 ) and zorro  
a big remake of the haunting  
and big special effects  
so what do they all amount to ? 
unfortunately for us , a big bore ! 
plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing  
unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear  
critique : this movie just didn't scare me one bit  
sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us  
well , this film didn't do much for me  
and they might as well have called it the "" haunting of lily taylor "" , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place  
don't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard "" comic relief "" , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension  
neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy  
it's all too sad , cause certainly the "" idea "" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone    poof ! ) and the special effects ? 
well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry  
see it for zeta-jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining  
little known facts about this film and its stars : goofy actor owen wilson co-scripted indie favorites rushmore ( 8/10 ) and bottle rocket with director wes anderson  
his brother luke wilson is also an actor , who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so  
brother andrew is also an actor  
singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice , but i personally did not notice her  
she is well known for her number one single "" stay ( i missed you ) "" and goofy glasses  
the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors  
catherine zeta-jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael "" sex is my life "" douglas  
she stands 5'8 ""  
in 1998 , actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor

-1,"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds  
in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them  
now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die  
they've been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times  
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
it's really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i  e  
have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie )  
such is the case with this movie's mini-plots  
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer  
the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny  
at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
he made the character and he is the character  
d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption  
as for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind "

-1,"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture  
even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics  
writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion  
instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way  
no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful  
the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better  
alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio  
and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town  
peeks of sunshine are few and far between  
no wonder the characters are all so miserable  
first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home  
that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi )  
the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other  
claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children  
then charlie re-enters the mix  
so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? 
who cares ? ? 
no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle  
so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time  
they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline  
they should know the ending as well as we do  
and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two  
another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters  
blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance  
sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell  
none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes  
edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here  
jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish  
the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia  
as portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love  
burns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job  
when he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) "
-1,"well there goes another one  
sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good  
this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite  
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right  
with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date  
here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years  
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up  
he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch )  
so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad  
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any  
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars     as 
long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm  
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs  
even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good  
the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old  
the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any  
even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him  
rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout  
her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen  
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old  
one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before  
it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness  
'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all  
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career "
-1,"saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn't too impressed  
this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama  
sound cliche ? 
that's only the beginning  
billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character  
he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him  
then he goes "" crazy "" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it  
i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting    
but it didn't all come together  
i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle    
but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations  
there was very little logical development in these characters  
my biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible  
they began to resemble g  i  joes , the greatest american hero  
and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls  
now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type  
so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the "" real life "" feel of covert operations in panama  
a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice  
the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background    
and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography  
many have seen the slowed down "" bullet-cam "" following the projectile to its target  
this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill  
it was dramatic when used in flashback "
-1,"one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles  
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star  
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film  
unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for  
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do  
then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is  
the plot of men with guns can be summarized "" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas  
dr  fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went  
and he found out again and again and again  "" 
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell  
a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians  
but the film talks down to the viewer  
dr  fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country  
he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios  
fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service  
then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy  
in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others  
the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be  
fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general  
the results are little different than one would expect  
dr  fuentes starts out incredibly naive  
even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr  fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains  
but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was  
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians  
the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences  
federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos "
-1,"rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality  
starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko  
running time : 117 minutes 
directed by : christian duguay 
i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career  
he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs  
his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled "" blade ""  
he has had his typical action movies , "" boiling point "" , "" passenger 57 "" , but his new movie "" the art of war "" should just be called "" rising sun 2 : the art of war "" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance  
wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u  n  after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do  
anne archer plays his "" boss "" type person of the u  n  and she has hired snipes to track down the killer  
well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way  
all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie  
wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before  
the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's "" blade ""  
i walked into "" the art of war "" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush  
the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on  
the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock "" the matrix "" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid  
christian duguay's direction is also not that great  
his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done  
even the whole "" matrix "" ending wasn't even good  
the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed  
his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie  
anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here  
she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves  
even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust  
so for an overall opinion : "" the art of war "" is a total waste of time  
it's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed  
it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all "

-1,"chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck  
the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr  ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder  
this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius  
that would be pretty nasty  
the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr  richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island  
long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance  
the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops  
upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder  
protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr  ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder  
all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees  
this proves to be tricky  
among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle  
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing  
to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice  
director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie  
when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it  
perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice  
take the villains , for example  
they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen  
they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways  
the tag-team of gooding jr  and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is  
frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man  
i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner  
gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' 
this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets  
but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous  
at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character "

-1,"the cartoon is way better  
that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature  
the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic "" home alone "" with puppies , and not much else  
when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be "" why ? 
the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? "" 
the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign  
the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple  
two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight  
they drag their "" human pets "" together , and in a short time both couples marry  
the heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy's new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts  
everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies  
in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities  
we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog's view of humans as their pets  
in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless  
hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks  
while he drew the desired "" aww , they're so cute "" reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering "" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that ? "" 
the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little  
joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles  
in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona  
in "" something wild "" , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor  
in "" terms of endearment "" , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer  
here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film  
glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality  
as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance  
close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself  
with a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature  
she's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious  
when she spits out lines like "" you've won the battle , but i'm about to win the wardrobe ! , "" 
the film comes briefly to life  
 "" 101 dalmatians "" is crammed with john hughes' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy  
after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park  a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on  
the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence  
 "" 101 dalmatians "" has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another "

-1,"synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night  
while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter  
comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement  
i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter  
suspense ? 
family drama ? 
humor ? 
erotica ? 
elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them  
instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers  
i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing  
alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter  
her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies  
everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends  
the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds  
the father ( played by j  t  
walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend  
none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music  
the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason  
the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead  
the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes  
incredible ! 
 ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j  d  salinger  ) 
if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails  
there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute  
by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them  
no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception  
if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails  
i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs  
if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails  
the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting  
finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well "
-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end "

-1,"it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch  
take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like  
however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies  
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own  
mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it  
what a crock  
if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for  
why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending  
you're fired  
let's get someone else to do it  
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood  
the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized  
which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize  
in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money  
i miss originality in film , i really do  
i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original  
payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth  
while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman  
there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life  
and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant  
the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000  
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less  
he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand  
a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest  
this idea is completely stretched out  
gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with  
what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia  
$70 , 000 is like spare change to them  
they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him  
i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 "

-1,"the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l  a  confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors  
with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir  
 "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture  
overacted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too  
with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness  
in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc  there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical  
directed by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community  
particularly one  
kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner  
soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house  
next thing , she cries rape  
and the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues  
a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen  
even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer  
he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray  
you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role  
as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie  
the community is astonished  
reporters flee to the scene  
there's an 8  5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell )  
there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust  
we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful  
like so many thrillers these days , including "" the usual suspects "" and "" the game , "" "" wild things "" eschews character for plot  
mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany "" henry , "" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force  
george clinton's score is a delight to behold  
but it's the humans "
-1,"first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given  
for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over  
hopeful still ? 
well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , "" what do you think of my butterfly ? ""  
butterfly ? , 
i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! 
and then it hit me    
the scene had been snipped ! 
damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! 
we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! 
so    
no naked teri hatcher  
forget about that  
okay ? 
now    
heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch )  
everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat  
the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt  
what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues  
when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get  
the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide  
as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat    
no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene  
he's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression  
three-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself  
on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character  
eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box  
and lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's "" adventures of lois & clark ""  "
-1,"i love movies  
i really do  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  
then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money  
disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship  
along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin  ' 
'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does  
many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment  
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now  
jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless  
his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives  
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited  
hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture  ' 
way to go liz ! 
for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in    ah   er    ' 
before finally giving up and switching off  
another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick  ' 
unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny  ' 
instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick "

reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner  
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating  
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out  
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following  
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation  
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity  
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e  t  , 
tramps about in the woods  
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants    er , 
leggings )  
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera    well , 
as the earthquake slowly recedes  
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven  
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point  
this movie is really stupid "

sadie thompson ( u  s  a  , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w  somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson ""  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script  
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for  
still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds  
a c movie ; worth 2  50 if you can find it  
the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it  
perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light  
nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter  
as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over  
not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats  
boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night  
some gore  
don't bring children to this one "

-1," "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary  
that's right  
the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better  
this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic  
his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it  
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising  "" 
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost  
miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people  
it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic  
unlike dustin hoffman's performance in "" rain man "" or leonardo dicaprio's in "" what's eating gilbert grape , "" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting  
however , unlike "" rain man "" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , "" mercury rising "" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid  
hell , he doesn't even have to be shy  
in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm  
willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything  
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide  
of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents  
simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked  
jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon  
this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes  
late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop  
of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst  
i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating  
not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent  
the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point  
the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here "" mercury rising "" doesn't rise to the challenge  
the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including "" sea of love "" ( 1989 ) and "" malice "" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion  
there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were  
the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way  
taken as a whole , "" mercury rising "" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor "
-1,"michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement  
in about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic "" big game , "" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined  
all that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s  
i can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd  
obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball  
it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam  
out of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000  
instead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend  
reeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely  
the drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs  
and maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game  
one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any  
the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie  
that wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them  
most of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised  
there's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling  
the worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself  
the adults also don't fare well  
reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser  
the character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance  
every time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up  
kids are supposed to rally around this guy ? 
diane lane , who co-stars as reeves' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof )  
it's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , "" these kids trust you , and they don't trust anyone ! "" 
then there's d  b  
sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again  
i wanted hardball to be good  
robbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved  
i haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that "" macho man "" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions  
robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience  
here's hoping that happens in the immediate future "

-1,"fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen  
the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr  nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl  
some shady u  s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard  
and what's more , this beast is heading for new york  
gulp ! 
although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie  
the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies  
broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image  
while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither  
also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting  
she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap  
it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent  
shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film  
hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture  
also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter  
o  k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies  
but what about the script ? 
well , that's not up to par either  
emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script  
the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish  ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , 
broderick forever remains a geeky scientist  ) 
also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour  
the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert  
 ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! 
ha ha ha ha !  ) 
the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i  e  
velicorapters ) running around new york  
right , so the script and acting suck  
but what about the special effects ? 
thankfully , they're are quite good "
-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight )  
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic  
it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir  
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on  
but why ? 
his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  
the kind who just won't die  
hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" )  
they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w  bush's republican national convention speech ( i  e  
bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 
to what end ? "" -- 
this actually got applause ! 
suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd )  
the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 
ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 
as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at )  
they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself  
caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  
our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) 
begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  
it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow  
like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than "" audiences will pay for anything these days ""  
it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride  
verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  
how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? 
a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  
hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot  
but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway "
-1,"ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? 
it's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined  
i felt the same way watching drowning mona  
skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy  
there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing  
there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n  y  , being a test town for the then new yugo  
everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates  
even the police chief drives one  
there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets  
there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred  
it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends  
it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend  
there are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona's tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted  
still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond  
the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler )  
each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more  
there's no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness  
anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is  
the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts  
each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization  
there is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag  
mona's son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth  
chief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter  
there's nothing more to him  
elle , the chief's daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married  
mona's husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch  
bob ( affleck ) , elle's betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard  
there is no contrast to any of the characters  
by having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better "

book of shadows : blair witch 2 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy  
we expect these events  
we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to  
it's part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society

politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong  
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesn't merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
 "" the blair witch project "" was made with a budget of $1  75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real  
the film itself was even more convincing  
the movie _must_ be authentic  
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? 
the first film caught lightning in a bottle  
the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle  
you have to give this effort some credit  
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids  
it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked  
instead "" book of shadows "" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release  
it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
unfortunately it doesn't work either

-1,"synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce  
diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael  
diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people  
comments : the ex is a very bad movie  
i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while  
i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars )  
as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie  
i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000  
the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind )  
those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script  
the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie  
diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime )  
david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger  
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made  
molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son  
time and time again , things do not add up in this movie  
if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex  
if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better  
i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp  
even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful  
the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david )  
these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience  
the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along  
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane  
when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states "" i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated  "" 
or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? 
 ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's  
therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies )  
having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : "" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr  jones ? 
oh , that's right  
'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' "" 
this is what passes for humor in the film "

for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross  
with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight  
after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth    
i have never liked john carpenter and his style  
after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed  
john carpenter remains john carpenter  
however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time  
neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original  
but there are some things that are interesting  
the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance  
at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life  
otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy  
carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere  
set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness  
more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil  
the cinematography by gary b  kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement  
music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice  
when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing  
he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the "" breed of evil ""  
woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance  
daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner

after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past  
so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? 
to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable  
the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested  
i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it  
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad  
i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11  
and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning )  
but , i digress  
despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series  
one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background  
oh yeah , dylan's "" knockin' on heaven's door "" and bowie's "" i'm afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste  
two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound  
the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end  
characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible  
during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background  
when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear  
as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke  
this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely  
finally , this is commercial television "

-1,"capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? 
starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that  
it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed  
it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time  
why am i calling this movie pornography ? 
pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts  
i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as "" a near-pornographic eternity ""  
i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout "" do 'er , man , do 'er ! "" 
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers  
it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk  
it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening  
the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence  
to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles  
this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome  
 ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too  ) 
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic  
they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense  
they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them  
we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate  
here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? 
hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine  
if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us  
the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be "" screen typist "" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other  
one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again  
once or twice is fine  
by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome  
there's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle  
also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry  
if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing  
but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip  
uh-huh  
the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor  
i say "" quasi- "" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc  -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject "
-1,"written by david j  schow and john shirley , based on the comic book series and comic book strip by james o'barr  
cast brandon lee , ernie hudson , michael wincott , david patrick kelly , rochelle davis , and jon polito  
mpaa rating "" r "" ( presumably for rape , language , and violence ) 
running time 100 minutes 
 "" looks like he zigged when he should've zagged  "" 
- ernie hudson , as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death  
comic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception  
despite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee's final film doesn't fly very high  
the story opens on halloween eve , better known as devil's night  
wilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from  
the cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order  
she dies , the perps  
escape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge  
sound familiar ? 
unlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee's character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2  by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration  
wearing what appears to be alice cooper's leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner  
but no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman  
 ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though  
 : ) 
a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life  
his two "" best "" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith  
blame said editors for the film's frightful flashbacks , as well  
but the pace is quick , thank god , and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins  
the cast is better than it should be  
ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film's funnier lines  
newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and draven's scrappy ward  
jon polito has a small , succulent role as pungent pawnbroker  
and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr  big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii  
there can be only one  
finally , there's brandon lee , son of bruce lee , and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting  
lee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie , laser mission , showdown in little toyko , and rapid fire-- and the crow would've been a nice feather in his belt and that's about it "
-1,"the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles  
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update  
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : "" quality "" films ) compete for audiences  
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season  
it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic  
i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment  
are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of "" uniqueness "" betty dolls out is ? 
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material  
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation  
it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it  
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock )  
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities  
she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love  
betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr  david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit  
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime  
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "" average "" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are  
in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim "" boys will be boys ""  
another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! 
what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic  
obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it  
he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience  
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue  
they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays )  
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show  
surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks  
that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body  
it's the best work she's ever done  
freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it  
the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality  
that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle  
the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing "
-1,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us  
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" 
i'm wondering the same thing  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city  "" 
it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't  
i just didn't  
surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
no , but i expected something  
a funny joke  
a clever prank  
a plot development  
anything  
the movie never delivers  
you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
 "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization  
the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan  
that's it  
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot  
the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington )  
they have a garage band  
they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them  
they have tickets , they lose them  
they get more tickets , they lose those too  
they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire  
there's not much more to it  
frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  
oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  
she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already  
it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  
we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy  
then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time  
 "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close "
-1,"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches  
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics  
spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story  
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken  
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films  
_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day  
ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers  
the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france  
there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie  
the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done  
the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat  
another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops  
the technical side of the film is peerless , as always  
the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw  
hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel  
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events  
it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince  
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency )  
for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground  
here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man  
but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact  
there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds )  
the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film  
ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war  
rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments  "" 
another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing  
anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup  
 "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "" 
asks one infantrymen in the group of eight  
rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "" 
or some variant thereof  
conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex "
-1,"one of my brother's favorite movies is h  b  halicki's 1974 cult flick "" gone is sixty seconds , "" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's  
chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal  
although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of "" gone in sixty seconds "" is relatively weak and dull  
randall "" memphis "" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track  
he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars  
however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble  
kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week  
calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies  
memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t  j  
cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval )  
as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients  
watching "" gone , "" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one  
maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for "" eleanor , "" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis  
but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait  
i had high hopes for "" gone "" because it is director dominic sena's second film  
 "" kalifornia , "" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience  
in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance  
in "" gone "" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn't mesh with this plot  
 "" gone "" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough  
it's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense  
this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it  
the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever  
the weak script is a waste of a talented cast  
in a "" newsweek "" interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies  
much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( "" leaving las vegas , "" "" bringing out the dead "" ) , there are two major stinkers ( "" snake eyes , "" "" con air , "" "" 8mm , "" "" city of angels "" )  
that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent  
it's a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like "" gone in 60 seconds "
-1,"how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ? 
in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it  
if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job  
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this ? 
honestly , i'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ? 
truth be known , i don't really think i can answer this question  
to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls  
unless you're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them  
they're a group of five busty british babes who've had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions  
they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra  
all five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names  
there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c  ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b  ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names  
the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame  
it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves  
they don't take themselves too seriously , and that's probably the best thing about them  
it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing  
they're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves )  
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music , while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie  
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  
most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud ! 
if you're a big fan of the group , you probably won't get enough of what you want , and if you're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments  
for the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline  
other key actors include richard e  grant as clifford , the spice girls' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role  
all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film wasn't meant to be acted seriously  
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it  
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles' a hard day's night , i think that is an unjust comparison  
it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i don't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so  
i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious  
i don't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step  
and what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ? 
probably nothing , and so it is  
spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn't even give a good review "

i agreed to go  
ugh  
in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn't dreamed by an american  
it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of "" little indian , big city "" ( french title - "" un indien dans la ville "" )  
i stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea  
but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement  
the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage  
let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something  
he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this    thing 
 ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good )  
she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off  
he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think    or 
as the bad joke goes - "" mitsubishi "" - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty    you 
know the drill  
now this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city  
tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn't able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short  
a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! ) 
tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries  
the story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting "

likewise for token appearances by marsha "" roz "" warfield , paul rodriguez and "" politically incorrect "" host bill maher , before he was somebody

d  c  cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs  
you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the "" token white guy "" ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word "" honkey "" as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr  t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin )  
we've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's  
some are fun to watch and some are actually funny  
this one is more or less neither

see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances  
it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity  
as for what the movie is actually about    well , that will all sort itself out eventually  
i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with  
maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too  
eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind  
twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort  
eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required  
whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team  
coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount  
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team  
the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach  
the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops  
incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning  
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants  
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do  
those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic  
those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing  
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players  
this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players )  
perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick  
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , "" don't blame me , i just work here  "" 
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while  
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas  
and those are the real jokes in eddie  
nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , "" hey , it's donald trump ! "" 
or "" hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! "" 
it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right "

-1,"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies  
we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting  
since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together  
i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along  
he was not amused  
i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained  
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity  
i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft  
the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque  
this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy  
the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean  
an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect  
in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed  
the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good  
the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets'  
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck  
eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner  
in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet  ' 
it's enough to melt the most callous heart  
at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know  ' 
she is only half right  
peter medak , the director , knows his business  
justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials  
james cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role  
marg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful  
natasha is an exquisite ornament  
george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up  
michael madsen was there  
black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard  "
-1,"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review  
because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex ""  
i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review  
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what  
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack  
it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it  
these are things we all do , sometimes  
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts  
their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed  
it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition  
michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say  
his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence ""  
huh ? 
and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get  
the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events  
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy  
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot  
i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others  
with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin  
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" )  
in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning  
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me  
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining  
if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side  
additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness  
or realism  
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters  
they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real "

-1,"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash  
maybe not ! 
mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether  
tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it  
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l  a  russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts  
stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money  
in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names  
tango & cash is unbearably noisy  
for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes  
to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier  
in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie  
screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv  
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier  
it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie  "" 
the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable  
they simply could have called it "" action movie  "" 
every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies  
adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon  
action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism  
the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography  
there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires  
the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell  
unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants  
the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing  
it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure "
-1,"ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad  
the review 
jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that  "" 
no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better  
while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns  
this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  
he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  
universal soldier : the return is truly poor  
the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier  
soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers  
considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead  
luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form  
in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program  
working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth  
unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside  
the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg )  
there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  
there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  
luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing  
erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn't leaving without her story ""  
whatever  
other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? )  
not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it  
when fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves  
director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found  
his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  
if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  
to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice  
i'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good  
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  
he cringes , looks down and mutters "" uh "

rated pg-13  
there's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl  
in rare cases , the genders are flipped  
predictability is a given  
rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its "" theme "" as an excuse for its plot contrivances  
 "" lightweight "" doesn't begin to describe it  
this is like anti-gravity  
it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy  
jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves  
after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating  
jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed  
when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand  
she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted  
to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend  
when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( "" love in the time of cholera "" ) and sell it to a used bookstore  
if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together  
three years later  
both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests  
both realize they aren't content  
both go looking for the other  
what happens now is so absurd that i'm almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it  
the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible "" coincidences "" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around "" serendipity  "" 
of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases  
i'm not buying it  
there's no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what's going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly "" adorable "" non-story into our heads  
instead of "" will they meet ? "" 
the question we're asking is "" when will they meet already ? "" 
to make matters worse , every "" coincidence "" is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else "" incredible "" was going to happen  
cusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn't saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she's had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one "

the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it  
besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film  
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film  "" 
 ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex  ) 
the film began     
the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett  
he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon  
 ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it  ) 
they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him  
brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her  
the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual  
kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't  
the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference  
his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party  
there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity  
kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations  
the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding  
kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows    
if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending  
    instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says "" i'm gay  "" 
this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart "

welcome to `ready to rumble'  
judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society  
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny  
unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling     
which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome'  
gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day , they transport raw sewage  
by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community

but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' 
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt  
along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well

i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful  
`rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive

upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! 
so shale does what any good teacher would do  
he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school  
ok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it's downright dumb  
if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun  
oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? 
and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story  
but over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language  
in fact , it reminded me of "" miami vice "" without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels  
if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it  
otherwise , wait for video  
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend

-1,"one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances  
now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this  
o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company  
he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her  
his reasons ? 
well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation    
i'd marry renee zellweger in a second )  
eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever  
he essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring  
the audience should now hate this character  
i did  
then the meat of the plot presents itself  
jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business  
however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away )  
having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition ""  
the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly  
it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point  
ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster's millions ? ""  
as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says "" what is this , brewster's millions ? "" 
it was quite surreal  
something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive  
up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good  
at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers  
when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story  
at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride  
these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman  
when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them  
as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off  
this goes on for the rest of the film  
it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women "
-1,"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle  
tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far  
badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves  
i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie  
furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence  
and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production  
of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line  
imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like  
with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse  
anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect  
the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors )  
the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough  
instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a  k  a  john clayton a  k  a  tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march )  
he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble  
meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization  
on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals  
one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help  
with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born  
its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability  
with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal  
his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off  
jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her  
some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover  
since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency "
-1,"do the folks at disney have no common decency ? 
they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick  
wasn't mr  magoo enough , people ? 
obviously not  
inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment  
younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity  
the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle  
all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite  
as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain  
in the cartoon , dr  claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer  
we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat  
as a child , i always imagined what dr  claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years  
with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's    
rupert everett ? ! 
only now , dr  claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' )  
he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version  
it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far  
when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr  claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool  
he does still have his cat , though  
in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost  
the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers  
broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people  
he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics  
but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world  
john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames  
in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys "
-1,"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions  
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l  jackson )  
they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow  
that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances  
certainly hodges is not complaining  
years pass  
hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer  
childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould  
because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops  
childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command  
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd  
more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down  
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians  
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film  
did childers violate authorized u  s  military rules of engagement ? 
or are there simply no rules in war ? 
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions  
the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u  s  where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 
where is the u  n  ? 
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 
this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism  
these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair  
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking  
one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility  
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed  
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality  
that is precisely why it's not offensive  
it is completely unobjective "

-1,"robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style  
overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber )  
so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble  
jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically "" uplifting "" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it  
williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii  
one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment  
jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast  
the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant "" heil hitler ! "" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto  
liberation ! he thinks  
the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along  
soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death  
this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate  
the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger  
in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home  
apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear  
he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning  
the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine  
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false  
such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope  
that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false  
it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by  
jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing  
robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent  
he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless  
not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love  
in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it  
here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor  
jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a "" holocaust comedy ""  
it's not a comedy  
it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works "
-1," "" knock off "" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie  
it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year  
i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found  
jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods  
rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays    
actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be  
she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there  
many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick  
where chan comes off as endearing in his "" normal guy "" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp  
we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions  
to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear  
the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong  
tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , "" double team "" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration  
we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe  
fabulous ! 
seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away  
for example , look at sam raimi  
 "" army of darkness "" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story  
that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp  
the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "" knock off "" to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more  
another problem with the film is that it looks cheap  
the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night  
and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed  
even the stars  
and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent  
for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window  
the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed  
seconds later , the car drives off at full speed  
hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere "

-1,"teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood  
every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand  
the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal  
you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span  
the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due  
that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash  
josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times  
she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office  
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life  
there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media  
so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation  
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c  reilly )  
the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter  
however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field  
obviously , the field assignment involves a high school  
specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them  "" 
i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t  
the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school  
interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again  
fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting  
they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body  
also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative  
the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing  
typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor  
one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical  
most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy  
but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie  
following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting  
it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film "

-1,"well , what are you going to expect ? 
it's a movie about a big snake that eats people  
that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more  
instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too  
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river  
led by anthropologists dr  steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives  
along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda  
to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is  
at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing  
cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help  
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake  
however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle  
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid  
in this movie , they're both  
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for  
you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else  
or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else  
at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake  
there are no standout performances here  
everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters  
even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason  
no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway  
in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real  
however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences  
sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast  
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud  
then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly  
absolutely ridiculous "

-1,"yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex  
neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? 
ok ! 
yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes  
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however  
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie  
but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises  
we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making  
guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts  
right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce "" mr  lombardo ""  
the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done  
on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day  
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations  
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor  
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray  
yes , that bill murray ! 
sound like a good , complete movie ? 
yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning  
in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film  
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time  
by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable  
unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about  
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been  
the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken  
the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing  
and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap "" party of five "" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones  
dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film  
in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade  
that's how cheezy it comes off  
but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's  
in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting  
and what's up with these people passing as high school students ? 
i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker  
i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure "

during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen "" alien ? "" 
have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good  
then you've seen "" supernova  "" 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either  
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded  
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped "

-1,"starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way  
now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel  
the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either  
fast forward to the late '80's  
steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years )  
nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role  
that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter  
the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original  
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets  
it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets  
the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's  
unlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap  
one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith  
she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars  
in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky  
seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite  
anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans  
the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets  
and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either  
anyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it  
not really , but that is how it seems  
this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original  
as i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy  
in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness  
although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon  
the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud  
although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows  
it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible  
sadly , it doesn't work very well  
if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original "
-1,"for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess  
in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman  
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place  
france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england  
there was no strong political leadership in the country  
morale was low , there being little hope for the future  
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions  "" 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him  
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown  
he does    
and she does  
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors  
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material  
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable  
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role  
ms  jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse  
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant  
since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part  
her joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed  
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii  
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death  
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor  
the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers  
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival  
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her "" visions  "" 
dustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan's conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial  
dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her "" revelations "

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much "
-1,"talk about beating a dead horse ! 
when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film  
the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited  
for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber  
now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the "" home alone "" name as well  
the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3  
by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest  
the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d  linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness  
he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was  
the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber  
in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls  
this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip  
instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school  
his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day  
through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u  s  air force integrated circuit comes into his possession  
it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it  
the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains  
the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable  
previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii  
these are far worse  
in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen  
if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ? 
there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children  
home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire  
it's one thing to see wyle e  coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen  
adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? 
the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill  
but , because this is a "" family film , "" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell  
not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive "

us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements 
copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson 
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader , do not misunderstand  
i did not have an anti-hype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem  
 "" who are these jedi knights ? "" 
i asked  
 "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" 
 "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" 
 "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" 
these were just some of my questions early on  
later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? "" 
and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
it's an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used "

comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers  
technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles  
 ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi  ) 
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isn't a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
they're awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio ! 
what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn  
 "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself  
 "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix ! "" 
unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book  
the latter is really too bad  
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer  
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  
people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices  
it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs  
watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books  
the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting  
basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat  
silly but kind of neat too  
i'm sorry  
i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie  
i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself  
this turkey is really cheesy "
-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense

-1,"capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie  
the gags are sporadically funny  
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes  
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team  
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film  
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching  
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night  
 ( and it turns out he had very good reasons  ) 
 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
a film needs a plot  
it needs characters for empathy value  
it needs a story and an emotional center  
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are  
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy  
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp  
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled  
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it  
his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience  
jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes  
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call  
for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny  
there was not enough cleverness or variety  
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay  
penis jokes work only so many times  
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags  
they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico  
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners  
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts  
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads  
jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks  
this leaves them at loose ends "

and now , "" starship troopers "" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug  
 "" starship troopers , "" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects  
in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale  
to put it simply , it's a bug bomb  
in "" robocop "" and "" total recall , "" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and "" starship troopers "" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise  
things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school  
inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial  
it's a veritable "" alpha centuri 90210 "" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love  
michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities  
eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds  
one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( "" doogie houser's "" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities  
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg  
a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the "" showgirls "" director's camera roams over their buff bodies  
finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy  
the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space  
they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears  
yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts  
a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best  
sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter  
the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating  
the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension  
while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly  
verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children "" doing their part for the war effort "" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck  
one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here  
his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders "
-1,"disconnect the phone line  
don't accept the charges  
do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up'  
i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so  
the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes'  
meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease  
while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery  
`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests  
for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development  
this is an annoying and ineffective device  
cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems  
if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story  
granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film  
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck  
the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale  
we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career  
georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called     
`georgia'  
maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog  
ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up'  
kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted  
ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle  
her frenzy is apparent  
for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles  
the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing  
even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill  
that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film "

-1,"movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents  ? 
the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions  ? 
there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance )  ? 
six days , seven nights is simply a waste  
let's see  
  
  
we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island  ? 
so , how do we do that ? ? 
well , we'll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we'll make him a crusty old pilot  ? 
but wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer  ? 
but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ? 
i know ! ? 
they'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ? 
yessssss ! ? 
so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes  ? 
shucks  
oh , i've got it ! ? 
we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty  ? 
then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ? 
then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them  ? 
oh , yes ! ? 
i feel so good about this story  ? 
instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ? 
imagine that  
don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job  ? 
the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent  
 ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard  ? 
schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get  ? 
and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting  ? 
even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences  
it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces  ? 
the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely  ? 
the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , "" why did you pick this awful script ! ? "" ? 
the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying  ? 
for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty  ? 
this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford  ? 
in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story  
this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb  ? 
1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters "
-1," "" spawn "" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster  
it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them  
in a classic example of telling and not showing , "" spawn "" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how "" men are the ones who create evil on earth  "" 
so much for a message  
the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant  
simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin )  
of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d  b  
sweeney )  
his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's  
clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn  
wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that "" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash  "" 
phew  got all that ? 
it would be easy to dismiss "" spawn "" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level  
the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated  
the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks  
other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image  
in movies like "" contact , "" the special effects serve the story  
in "" spawn , "" they are the story  
and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character  
the film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped  
what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker  
even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn  
poor leguizamo  
he starred in february's "" the pest , "" a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money  
as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline  
leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon  
the guy was brilliant in "" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! 
julie newmar  "" 
what is he doing wasting his talent in this and "" the pest "" ? 
i'm one of the few people that liked "" batman & robin , "" this summer's other big-budget comic book film  
yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of "" batman "" as the superior adaptation "
-1,"an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london  
where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms  
where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny  
in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity )  
the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping  
soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all  
she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache )  
serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out  
however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't  
she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself  
actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie  
she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate  
this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience  
delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her  
delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise  
she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both  
given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives  
it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss  
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts  
the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay  
tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie  
it would be kind to call him bland  
actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive  
julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat  
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal  
on the technical side , it's all bad news  
the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal  
the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits  
repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious  
and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to "
-1,"i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder  
i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

-1,"plot : lara croft is british , rich and kicks a lot of ass  
she also likes to raid tombs but when the illuminata discover that all nine planets are about to stand in alignment for the first time in 5000 years , and that lara holds the key to time , well , needless to say , they want to nab it from her  
oh yeah , lara also likes to sport a lot of tight shirts    hummana-hummana-hummana    
critique : angelina jolie was great in this movie  
there were also about three "" action scenes "" that were pretty cool to look at in this film  
uhhhhhm , unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked ! 
bad dialogue , generic sidekicks and bad guys , a lame mystery , yoda-esque moments with mumbo-jumbo being sprouted about and even some crappy cgi near the end  
all in all , this movie wasn't the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about , especially since every other scene does feature jolie's torpedoes begging to burst out of her lucky shirts , but it was quite the letdown nonetheless , especially when you consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool , hip woman hero , based on a popular video game  
i don't know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who didn't really tie the whole movie together all that well  
the film lacked energy , a consistent pace and well    a 
fun time ! 
i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie  
all that "" father "" crap was horrible and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing ( and i'm not even gonna mention his moustache    hehehe )  
why have this shite in the movie at all ? ! ? 
i especially hated the scenes in which some ghost-like figure , friend or child would ramble on about lara croft's father while all the time , i'm not giving one ounce of crap as to what they're talking about  
i guess that's called lack of "" character development "" , right ? 
that's when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen , so that we could actually "" get into "" it and care about them  
i didn't care about anyone in this movie , and was bored during most of its "" let's explain why we're doing all this gobbledygook "" moments  
and even though i thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass ( damn , did she look sexy blasting those guns or what ? ! ? ) , everybody else around her was so goddamn boring ! 
her butler was a throwaway with no personality , her side-kick was supposed to be funny but just annoyed me every time he said the word "" bugger "" ( and he says it a lot , trust me ! ) and all of the so-called bad guys just spewed one-dimension ! 
they had no spark , no energy amongst them , and even though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool ( see the trailer and you'll know which ones i'm talking about ) , the overall picture was lame and the dialogue and mystical bull-crap just buried it even further  
also , for a movie that's supposed to be about all of these exotic locations , i wasn't necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots , and even less so with its interiors , which all looked like they were shot in the same room  
mind you , i won't go as far as to say that it's the "" worst movie of the year "" ( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr  movies also ! ) , but it's definitely the worst film that i've seen during this summer movie season ( of course , it's still early and i'm sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike )  
skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead  "
-1,"what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project  
most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films  
john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin  
screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd  
ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes  
even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules  
when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining  
after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration  
the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining  
the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are  
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights  
we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar  
the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun  
reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest  
evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! "" 
and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments  
the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain )  
nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person  
when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays  
unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship  
thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard  
now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel  
confused ? 
the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax  
but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour  
the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley  
some hero  
the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire  
when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times  
the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason  
the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead  
the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food "
-1,"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger  
he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck  
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art )  
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" )  
of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind    of 
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people  
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't  
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" )  
but this one has a special place in my heart  
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it  
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000  "" 
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine  
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land  
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off    or 
does he ? 
seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here  
one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c  mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory    literally , 
of course  
at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up  
he even goes as far as to say , "" i don't want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is "

-1,"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality  
like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies  
consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe  
let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset  
the best word to describe this film is "" asinine  "" 
the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty  
krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules  
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist  
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two  
finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work  
once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college  
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished  
shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own  
now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings  
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu ""  
to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb  
soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon  
but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud  
the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt  
unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this  
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags  
meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i  e  , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative  
the acting in underwhelming  
dreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf  
alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else  
this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie  
no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels  
i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer "

-1,"i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it  
however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i  e  
i didn't like it  
if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal  
that's the kernel of it , anyway  
tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship  
unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace  
actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was  
they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones  
they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction  
three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town  
one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives  
in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be  
he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones  
even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him  
anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character  
we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland  
as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague  
and then there's the special effects  
not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse  
i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt  
nope , it's another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , "" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet "" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn't know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act  
f'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! 
let him loose ! 
let him grin demonically ! 
skip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! 
watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , "" what a waste ""  
if you're going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman  
nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he's not sure what he should be doing next  
and no wonder  
this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it'd just love to be allegory , but it's not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it'll think of something  
so what is the witches of eastwick ? 
a horror movie ? 
a folk tale ? 
a comedy ? 
a statement about women ? 
an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? 
i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me  "

-1,"there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book "" screenwriting made easy  "" 
this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film  
it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters  
yes , "" the poseidon adventure "" is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters  
and "" earthquake , "" my god ! 
 "" earthquake "" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold  
 "" volcano "" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops    only 
it's in , dare i say it ? 
l  a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it  
they're just stupid  
and the actors are all good ones  
tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer )  
anne heche is a good indy actress  
don cheadle stole the disappointing "" devil in a blue dress "" from denzel's feet  
and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors  
but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on  
they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film )  
there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone  
i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! )  
and there are no interesting sites in l  a  that we see get destroyed  
part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever  
in "" independence day , "" the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens  
that was cool  
watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not  
okay , so the film's not devoid of merit  
as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best  
and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool "

-1,"when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment  
even politicians ( ! ) 
tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction  
these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be  
thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation  
similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess  
the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world  
12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie  
meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow  
pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core  
it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for  
so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather  
pay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ?  
hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? "" 
leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment  
 ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all )  
these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings  
while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience  
it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns  
one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip  
spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance  
maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference  
the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender  
in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol  
the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar  
pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards  
the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists  
even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections  
his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : "" boy this outta floor em ""  
naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher  
never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary  
nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics "

-1,"as bad as "" mimic "" was , it definitly scared me  
 "" mimic "" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie  
director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film "" cronos  "" 
that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie  
in "" mimic "" , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original  
the plot is a stupid combination of "" aliens "" meets "" species "" meets "" jurassic park  "" 
the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies  
there's nothing new in "" mimic ""  
it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work  
at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back  
maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on  
i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the "" seven "" trend and be set in dark , dank areas  
watching "" mimic "" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen "" turn the lights on ! 
the switch is to your right ! 
use common sense ! 
just do it ! 
you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "" 
there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off  
it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts  
 "" hmmm     
i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight  "" 
 "" mimic "" has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! 
just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you  
the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too  
i shouldn't blame del toro  
he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie  
hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , "" the killer "" and "" hard boiled "" then came to america to make the stupid "" broken arrow  "" 
french directors luc besson ( "" la femme nikita "" ) and george sluizer ( "" the vanishing "" ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies  
robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget "" el mariachi "" came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget "" desperado  "" 
i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie  
woo finally broke through and made "" face/off "" , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films  
i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , "" welcome to america ! 
i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long  
do you speak english ? 
now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here "

-1,"i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream  "" 
maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the "" scream "" flicks as well as the "" i know what you did last summer "" soon to be flicks  
it owes less to "" halloween "" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of "" the stepford wives , "" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
 "" behavior , "" starring katie holmes of "" dawson's creek , "" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suck-ups  
preppies  
it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like "" beautiful girls "" and "" things to do in denver when you're dead "" ( as well as "" con air "" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as "" the movies with potential that blow it  "" 
i remember a film called "" white man's burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise  
here's another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesn't  
it's too sloppy and too contrived  
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life    then 
lets it lie  
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes    then 
gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal  
isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? 
the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from "" dawson's creek "" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from "" the man without a face "" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension  
in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't "

-1,"a friend invites you to a movie  
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality  
the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city  
they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over  
romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance )  
it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood  
you accept  
you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_  
but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned  
alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_  
oh , woe  
your hope has sunk  
why was this movie made ? 
why was it released ? 
it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved  
at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem  
but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers  
_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife )  
birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume  
what is the point of this ? 
does it make any sense ? 
is it supposed to be funny ? 
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child  
all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none  
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion  
there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job  
there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's  
and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr  , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch  
and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question  
what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? 
what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? 
outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block

when birdy almost loses her job  
when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up  
when someone dies "
-1,"starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that  
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman  
these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins  
so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins  
so much for hopes  
schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy  
unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding  
still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse  
so , dr  hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug  
their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman  
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 
well , it must have to the producers of junior  
admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off  
perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny  
but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best  
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny  
schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics  
i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture  
better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? 
anything would have been better than this mess  
danny devito is wasted in this movie  
his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street  
 ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street  ) 
emma thompson is wasted here as well  
while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian  
too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here  
am i being too hard on this film ? 
i don't think so  
schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood  
with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film  
they certainly managed here  
maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made "

-1," "" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , "" 
screams the television ads for "" hanging up , "" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton  
make me laugh again ! 
not only is "" hanging up "" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes  
and we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? 
excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion  
eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james )  
her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him )  
while eve's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up's and down's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic  
her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress  
interestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them  
maddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another  
and they talk  
and talk  
and talk    
in fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long  
if you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest  
the question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? 
how could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? 
issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought  
also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes  
and when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children  
you can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other  
you think to yourself : "" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , "" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits  
meg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998's "" hurlyburly "" or 1994's "" when a man loves a woman "" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies  
with "" hanging up , "" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle  
even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations  
diane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment  
what is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan's senior  
yeah , right  
lastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999's "" analyze this  "" 
kudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue  
if anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998's "" the opposite of sex "
-1,"capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace  
there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise  
john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  
john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes  
for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make  
ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace  
in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue  
this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness  
it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way  
but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience  
ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176  
mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget )  
it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film  
society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little  
apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control  
and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things  
society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten  
the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony  
instead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson , this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams  
instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars  
because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination  
the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback  
ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black  
carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat  
sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup  
the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss  
his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring  
these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience  
somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights "
-1,"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros  , have never generated much interest at the box office  
but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well  
with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy  
it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most'  
and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video  
in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity  
the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation  
mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition  
despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth  
outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel  
earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces  
it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie  
it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story  
this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more  
they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act  
this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana  
the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best  
they spoke little , but fought a lot  
thus , the movie was easy to digest  
however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably  
this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak  
not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e  g  
useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom  
try reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean  
but the movie is not a complete fatality  
fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility  
and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo  
even if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves "

-1,"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel  
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream  
and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it  
the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects  
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons  
i also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania  
at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene  
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech  
however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive  
off the high board  
suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball  
up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk  
if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical  
but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs  midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film  
indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces  
this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas  
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it  
and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare  
at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' 
then i realized he was , and i was watching it  
in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality  
note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph  
max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid  
her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna  
i found this scene offensive  
not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved  
i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all  
late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably  
this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! 
`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions  
a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person "
-1,"this is the worst movie i've seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way ""  
it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap  
it is crap through and through  
nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" )  
here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement  
but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre  
not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again  
there is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring  
they set up mr  freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners  
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death  
but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines  
as mr  freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass  
personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable  
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin ""  
apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold  
uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either  
her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right  
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment  
given the "" script "" , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently  
there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl  
michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance  
in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man  
unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart  
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist  
there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem  
the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive )  
even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable "
-1,"sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? 
yup , it's gotta be summer  
just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed  
the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff  
sound exciting ? 
dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing  
 ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! 
calling dean edell    ) 
so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny  
 ( oddly , no one thinks to just    
jump off the back of the boat  ) 
with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- 
the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated  
 ( what are the odds ? ) 
they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! )  
 ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? 
wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) 
bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests  
 ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor  
 ( his first lol line is to ms  bullock : "" i'd like to boogie with you  "" ) 
of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does  
he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards  
 ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy and michelle's high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven )  
worse , he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't even live up to its title ! 
there's no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town  
 ( oh , how far we've come in twenty years  
remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) 
admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission  
it's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that's pure nonsense  
and wonderful nonsense at that  
i know he didn't intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he's created the hands-down funniest film of the year  
so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : 
o a box with a big label : "" fiber optic converter "" 
o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions 
o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door 
o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening 
o a ships' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say "" i canna override it ! "" 
o willem dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard 
o two living , breathing adults ( bullock's character and the first mate ) who have to be told , step by step , how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade  
duh 
o "" no wait ! "" 
screams the ship's intercom 
o yet another damn dog in peril 
o fishing reel

-1," * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * 
cast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes 
the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but  
gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away  
don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot  
when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining  
what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected )  
before i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr  pepper  
every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it  
little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products  
dr  pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face  
these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film  
clich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars  
dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day )  
films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that )  
there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper "" u'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it  
this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on )  
scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating  
ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing  
his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes  
at other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic  
one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target  
mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme  
events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience  
we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest  
what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be "" smarter "" than i am )  
during the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn )  
a brief history lesson about "" where we came from "" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with "" the rest of our people "" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that "" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has "" )  
>from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater  
i'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going "

-1,"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell  
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable "

the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do "

-1,"did i do something bad ? 
i must have , because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment  
here's the plot  
ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network , one of those 24-hour home shopping channels  
the new boss ( robert loggia ) plans to can ricky's behind if he doesn't turn the previous months' flat sales numbers around , and to add to his problems , ricky also has to work with kate ( kelly preston ) , the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him  
kate and ricky don't get along and don't have any great ideas until they meet g ( eddie murphy ) , a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything  
his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good , and it's this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network's success  
the first problem is a flaw in the plot  
sure , g makes people feel good  
sure , we're told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item , no matter how wealthy they might be , and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought  
but , hey , that's after they've bought it  
why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera ? 
far from trying to sell the product , g instead blathers on about how you don't even need the thing  
someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place  
you might say that people feel good about what they've bought , so they come back and by more , but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable , i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind  
the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible  
another problem is in the humor  
you know , if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie , i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy  
whoa , partner , are you in for a surprise  
holy man is not funny  
murphy , the one asset you'd think this movie has ( remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense ? 
- then again , maybe you don't ) is seriously reigned in  
the script gives him almost nothing to work with , and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn't be left as window dressing  
there's only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose , and it lasts for three shouted words , which seem totally out of place as a result  
pathetic  
in all , there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture , and they're not even that great  
as a side note , there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine , and james brown introducing a medic-alert device that shouts "" help me ! "" 
just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button , but these never cause your personal laugh-o-meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement  
 "" well , "" you ask , "" surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor  "" 
think again , buckwheat  
jeff goldblum disappoints  
kelly preston is flat ( but not like that )  
robert loggia , in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast , can't do anything with it  
the script is part of the problem , but these actors don't even look like they believe in the move they're making "

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species  
squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't )  
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round  
so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid  
the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can  
in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna  
patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring  
and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction  
species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around  
however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered  
mr  brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches  
like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious  
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here  "" 
this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful  "" 
and she's not even empathic ! 
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he's going to rape her  "" 
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own  
there's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( "" he's in aisle 1 ! "" 
informs eve )  
if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion  
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief  
the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ? 
why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? 
my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks  
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public  
returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms  helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis  
mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film  
mr  lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms "

so then he thought , "" let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes "" ? ! ? 
strange dude and one crappy flick  
plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god  
a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl's aunt wants to    well , 
save her from those damn devil worshippers ! 
enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you've just about got the gist of things here  
critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot  
what's good about this movie ? 
well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around  
the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much  
and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film's entire basis of believability  
for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes    is 
a dumb one ! 
add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? 
at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you've got yourself a pretty bad movie  
and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? 
did they owe the director a favor or something ? 
together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs  
the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of "" sneaking up "" on a man's house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! 
uuuhmm    how's 
about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! 
anyway , i don't usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around )  
and did basinger lose some of her acting "" talent "" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? 
difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly  
either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film  
but if you really don't mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and "" kid "" -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don't bring anything new to the table   "
-1,"best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e  , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives  ) 
he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano )  
in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52  
he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e  , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it  )

-1,"it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur  ) 
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller ? 
they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) 
harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck )  
once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic  
 "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack  
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen  
 ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain  ) 
whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "" 
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework  
it has a vivid soundmix  
but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story  
the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever  
bollocks ! 
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler  
remember a little film called jaws ? 
in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark  
they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another "
-1,"capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made  
christopher lambert vs  evil ninjas in modern-day japan    
and nobody wins  
the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it  
i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting  
christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan  
he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone )  
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered  
since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die  
let's stop and think about this for a second  
if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock  
in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him  
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body  
you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is  
this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems  
lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun  
they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows  
the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them  
lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional  
the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him  
in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype  
what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful  
also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany  
there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot  
by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care  
we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! 
someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way  
this movie bungles two out of three , badly "

well , maybe that's not true  
  
  
maybe you're curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose  
you just have to know how bad bad can be  
if that's the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that sgt  
pepper's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs  
derived from the lyrics of various beatles' songs , sgt  
pepper's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967  
of course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story doesn't correlate to the song at all  
and oh , what joy - we're the lovely audience they'd like to take home with them  
i don't think so  
but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields  
the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! 
steve martin ? ! ? 
alice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70's fashion and faces  
check please ! 
the plot is a bit unclear  
people with bad 70's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr  rogers  
mean mr  mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co  's instruments , calling dr  maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid  
supposedly this is a horrible thing ? 
i guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent  
meanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic "" sex , drugs , and rock n' roll "" thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy  
she sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs  
fields ! 
hey , wanna cookie ? ) 
all alone to sing a horrible rendition of "" she's leaving home "" , accompanied by those same creepy robots  
but is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ? 
ya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ? 
well , there's some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop , and i assume that's who it was  
it's movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , "" what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? ""

-1," "" houston  we have a serious problem  "" 
after making "" mission : impossible "" , brian de palma has a lot to live up to  
by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience  
and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster  
starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from "" apollo 13 "" , de palma slowly builds up his "" story ""  
the human race has already set foot on mars  
a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened  
this is basically the whole plot  
so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours  
but de palma manages to do that  
it is not a very good achievement  
as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake  
the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is  
david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake  
de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot  
the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , "" apollo 13 "" and "" godzilla ""  
to make time pass , the creators have inserted several "" refreshing "" scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog  
it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories  
when it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity  
i can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this  
sometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh  
you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this "" constantly surprising "" tour you'll see -- an alien  
it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but "" lost in space "" is actually better  
that's an achievement in itself ! 
director brian de palma has stroke gold with "" untouchables "" that became an instant american classic  
it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten  
he'll live to fight another day ! 
i send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters  
and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent  
it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10  
unfortunately their hard work was in vain "

-1,"the "" disney stick-to-what-you-do-best "" rule states that disney's animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids' entertainment , they will fail miserably  
this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? 
i'm still trying to forget )  
that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children's film  
it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes  
it's films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects  
just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "" role "" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him  
he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr  brenda bradford ( joely fisher )  
but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer  
john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr  brenda's father  
dr  brenda has been working on a "" gadget project , "" which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime  
feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman  
now , when he says "" go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] "" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers  
in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown's worst nemesis  
claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d  l  
hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath  
state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere  
had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect  
what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing  
part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie  
can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams "" hey ! 
you ran a stop sign ! "" 
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? 
i think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool  
they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt  
in addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible  
there's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line  
there's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects  
it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called "" death slug ""  
each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco ! 
slug on a stick ! ) "
-1,"the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing  
however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel  
and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead  
the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is  
if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience  
of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an "" r "" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies  
there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring  
this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment  
somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as "" erotic  "" 
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism  
sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions  
anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater  
i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly )  
although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone  
this creature , dubbed "" eve "" by its creator , dr  laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile  
meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars  
a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them  
ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session  
his intention is obviously world domination  
standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson )  
but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there's no damping his ardor  
i'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects )  
michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run  
ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- "" underused "" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( "" invisible "" would be more like it )  
george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general  
meanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison  
the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick  
complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics  
director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness "

-1,"my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release )  
i didn't see the first film until much later  
so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it  
watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever  
you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before  
this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story  
plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless  
and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ? 
don't get me wrong though    
it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics  
most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is  
horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it  
a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video  
it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set  
the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided )  
the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5  1 mix  
also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography  
other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer  
some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that  
the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular  
the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago  
i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out  
everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all  
most of the time you'll forget he's even there  
everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible  
the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series  
also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film "

it's a mess  
and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up  
the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters  
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment  
i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to )  
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair  
either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist  
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid  
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy  "" 
and that's one of her wittier asides  
degeneres' sgt  
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of    wait  
to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses  
it's best described this way : 
sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a "" creative yet unfocused "" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney  
sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help  
ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his  
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again  
although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly  
probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears  
at least the former "" ellen "" star is going for something a little different  
arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : "" lost highway , "" "" true romance "" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like "" i'm not wearing any underwear  "" 
i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this  
here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity  
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers  
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite "" the sound of music "" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims  
so what was the point of the wig and the car ? 
 "" the sound of music "" stuff might be a reference to "" the wizard of oz "" allusions in david lynch's "" wild at heart , "" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that "" wild at heart "" was a despicable movie "

-1,"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one  
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup  
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out  
somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them  
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned  
sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create  
with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , 
something this bad can't help but look even worse  
the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received  
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon  
science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel  
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness  
but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful  
this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect  
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film  
there is some promise , but it's all in the setup  
we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered  
when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee  
on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission  
together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact  
for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation  
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities  
then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous  
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting  "" 
additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest  
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience  
what about that a-list cast ? 
not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l  jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue "

nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film

big-budget slasher film  
arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st  bank account ) from destroying the world  
the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth  
tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom  
but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : "" even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil  "" 
we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries  
the chosen woman is christine york ( robin )  
it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot  
he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations  
but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body  
it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman  
he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at "
-1,"as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things  
i am befuddled by fight club  
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later  
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time  
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them  
fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former  
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold  
but if it is , i sure don ? t see it  
edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer  
his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life  
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home  
once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally  
they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days  
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table  
but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ?  
now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today  
advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed  
 ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced  ) 
all of them play an important role  
how so ? 
well , i can kinda just tell  
i can ? t really put my finger on it  
to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news

i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time

were they living there before krypton exploded ?

how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art

bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
still haven't got the point ? 
other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly , this movie deserves a  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
so i'm giving it a  
and maybe that is too generous  
right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film  
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained  
so what is this movie about ? 
you ask  
like it really matters  
ok , here goes  
this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry  
once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them  
everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral  
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here  
other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
mr  ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out ""  
now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ?

future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo-jo    
aw forget it  
i'll stick to my day job  
this is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters aren't teens  
drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters  
the story she's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making  
she is to return to high school as a student and explain what's really going on  
the irony is that drew's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back  
when she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the "" i know the answer "" in class that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject  
at least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc's leelee sobieski--watch for her ) , who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are "" supposed "" to be more beautiful than her

smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate  
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization  
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital  
sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor

the film disproves that assumption

after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie  
comments : "" alan smithee "" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled "" fatal bore "" or "" fatal crap ""  
if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by "" alan smithee , "" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else  
 "" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad  
frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the "" alan smithee "" moniker for this film  
where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? 
let's start with the acting  
it's pretty bad  
amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material  
she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete  
her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke  
the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand  
christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm  
trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket  
if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here  
early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom  
outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film  
they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever  
fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills  
the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with  
this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault  
even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up  
so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale  
the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an "" erotic thriller ""  
a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic  
i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something "" erotic , "" that he'd be happy after watching this fluff  
a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative )  
on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through  
it's no wonder why she hated high school so much  
as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration "

they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script  
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes  
the residents of mystery love hockey  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football  
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes  ) 
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch  
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated  
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz  
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl  
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad  
on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition  
on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes  
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition  
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement  
he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife  
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding  
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth  
his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater  
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him  
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans  
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him  
he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it  
reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together  
one character actually was interesting  
biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey  
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community  
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open  
her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom "

director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth  
what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm  
john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell )  
brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods )  
soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who  
ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story  
perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something  
on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed  
the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and "" shocking "" plot developments  
having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree  
scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines  
 ( sunderland actually asks brenner , "" why was she killed ? "" 
to which i would have answered , "" if i knew , then the movie would already be over  "" ) 
only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored  
not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot  
in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask  
she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring  
instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap  
this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience  
it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise  
i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story  
this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct  
compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture  
these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be  
in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure  
this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up  
as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane  
perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances  
james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety  
i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous "

-1,"robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects  
he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her  
they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash  
just when it couldn't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr  ) 
annie can't take the grief anymore , and kills herself  
 ( all sounding like good fun so far ? ) 
the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow  ) 
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar  
this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made  
everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters  
williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face  
there's no emotion behind it  
sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film  
she may look pretty , but she can't act  
max von sydow is o  k as the traveller , if nothing special  
cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film  
it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement  
all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground  
there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers  
while films like e  t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically  
instead , it's all rather boring  
sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there's something lacking  
the script doesn't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ? s , and dud speeches  
richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams  
despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing  
the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid  
but there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects  
heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets  
but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 "

-1,"part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes  
in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard  
phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises  
elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune    instead 
the two are careless hawaiian surf bums  
to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go  
after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot  
they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits  
rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along  
phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a  
j  langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton )  
yellowstone has a problem  
it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs  
not just one or two    thousands of them  
the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p  dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper )  
the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted  
instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm  
a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways  
the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny  
there's a moment when phil utters the line , "" insert laugh here "" , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience  
the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way  
instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way  
the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting "
-1,
-1,"some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time  
playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one  
congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing  
some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed  
then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet  
harsh ? maybe  
justified ? 
hell yes ! 
this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes  
for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away  
this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look ! 
john woo ! 
two guns blazing ! 
slooooow motion ! "" 
and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie  
poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better  
unlike most movies this one does not suffer from "" stupid bad guy "" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes  
example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages  
now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero  
 ( term used as loosely as possible ) 
survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds  
even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger  
mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not  
some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! 
two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second  
solution ? 
boom ! 
i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much  
another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : 
our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her  
he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers  
he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? 
no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car  
and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! 
while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? 
i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door  
ask mr  wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life  
this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better  
is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? 
for instance : 
our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment  
ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time  
but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? 
he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt  
oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling  
going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun "
-1,
-1,"way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad  
one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance  
after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his "" target ""  
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate  
but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty  
here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory  
it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion  
unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that  
as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man  
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed  
but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit  
directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity  
unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it  
the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is  
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life  
even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc  i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously "" dramatic ""  
usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending  
nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential  
thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled  
however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason  
or substance  
it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be  
even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction "" are clever  
at one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass ""  
i've seen porno with better dialogue  
and some with better plot lines too  
but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy )  
caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness  
benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering "

-1,"one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie  
king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings  
it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains  
ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen  
his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ? 
the addiction is that movie  
walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout  
the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island )  
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model  ) 
matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
no kidding  
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle  
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him  
no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon  
in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs  
wider ! ) 
toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out  
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was  
suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all  
the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea  
cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits  
 "" yeah ! ! ! 
yeah ! ! ! 
arrrghhh ! "" 
says mr  hopper  
dirty old sod  ) 
it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny  
how's that for cryptic ? 
never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about  
i can picture it now  
 "" take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id

--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson )  
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave )  
april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot ( director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon ( also jeff b  harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality , dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick )  
when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married  
 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d  c  , destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own

-1,"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered ? 
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me    
keep reading )  
also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was )  
this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it  
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them  
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 
please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 
shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 
the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs ""  
why aren't they "" dog animals "" ? 
the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 
why do i even care at this point ? 
i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon )  
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 
he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta  
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee  
also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
ooooo , scary villain  
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  
you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth "
-1,
-1,"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality  
here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves  
swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless  
alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up  
what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter  
my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here )  
it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience  
maybe it will work for some people  
it didn't work for me  
billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania  
he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film  
the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall  
his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size  
subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago  
max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins  
sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved  
sam is broke  
max is dying  
pass the kleenex  
my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny  
it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself  
in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect )  
crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes  
muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well  
quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents  
she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff  
here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent  
all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre  
as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings  
sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) "

what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved "

-1,"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment  
with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance  
however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker  
this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center  
the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma  
they have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday  
now the three surviving girls must decide what to do  
it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up  
the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience  
to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth  
the girls' cover is surely blown    
not so fast  
thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance  
after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd  
does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? 
or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? 
jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add  
it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor  
it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot  
the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo  
at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths  
but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops  
the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film  
in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best  
as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she's in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however )  
it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact  ) 
jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie  
either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows  
the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters  
as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable "
-1,
-1,"the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective  
such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks  
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends  
examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house  
the killer wears one of those l  l  bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face  
i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days  
anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric  
it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come  
unfortunately , the film never takes off from there  
the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus  
like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac )  
i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill  
after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares  
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music  
i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days  
the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast  
the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew  
false scares should always be used in moderation  
someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be  
this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening  
remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? 
this movie still adheres to them  
tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list  
and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense  
that type of illogical can be fun  
this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember  
the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming  
actually , you won't be screaming at all  
at its best , the acting can barely be called "" adequate "" and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two "
-1,"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry  
cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed  
seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos  
fifty cars , to be exact  
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly  
if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip  
literally  
if only someone could save him  
hmmmm   wonder 
what memphis is doing ? 
in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of    yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension  
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away  
will he catch him ? 
there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago  
will they get back together ? 
shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family  
will they reconnect ? 
raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime  
will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? 
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? 
i'll bet you can  
following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis  
he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts  
in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions  
just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it  
looks like everything might turn out alright after all  
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins  
that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame  
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand  
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis "

-1,"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects  
set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon  
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells  
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes  
not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood  
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? 
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play  
this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale  
the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere  
in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box  
not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted  
it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot  
not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame  
when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail  
with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion  
abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft  
appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched  
director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration  
otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable  
ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings  
her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful  
abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here  
paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves  
probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character  
a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed  
unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost  
it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions  
his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message  
the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable  
when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed  
far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience "
-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! 
what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de ! 
bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end "

 "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie  "" 
-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin  
apparently , no one heard my words  
oh , how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because he's done it again  
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not  
in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well )  
he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy )  
when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments )  
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh ? 
also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back "

-1,"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island  
however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder  
while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself  
conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation  
his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice  
the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst  
without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement  
on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism  
in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another  
the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel  
its absence in the film is unforgivable  
the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers  
alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with  
the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him  
jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible  
unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script  
the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach  
all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone  
this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions  
the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london )  
the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization  
while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma  
sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as "" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror ""  
poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder  
sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back  
at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans  
despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended  
sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be  
the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production  
at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love "

-1,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey  
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star  
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars  
that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way )  
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension  
i even liked the computer-generated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isn't too bad either  
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex )  
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven  
that type of moviemaking is a lost art  
now for the bad news  
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue  
it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction  
 "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line  
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign  
second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay  
the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest  
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived  
when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil "
-1,"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way )  
the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely )  
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight  
i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" 
it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie  
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen  
kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more ""  
and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j  pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character ""    grammar 
be damned )  
 "" how did you know that ? "" 
the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along  
  
  
since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently  
he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects  
this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr  vehicles  
their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends ""  
reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head  
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick  
affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch  
the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting  
it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) 
james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron )  
ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him  
which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts  
he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino  
though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant  
this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner  
included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) "

finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  
combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs  
kramer "" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment  
in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? 
-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  
over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life  
he's screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter  
now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads  
a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them  
the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends  
one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up  
to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine  
jack is in even worse shape than harry  
he's dying of cancer with only a year to live  
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him  
instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes  
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before  
through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to  
it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about  
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario  
by the time they show you , it doesn't matter  
the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe  
these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither  
rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember  
a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform  
it's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course  
on the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen  
the three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs  
newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style  
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out "
-1,"i am continually amazed at movies like this  
that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays  
 "" wild wild west "" is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault  
in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs  
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal  
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring  
will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character  
west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach  
talk about deeply developed characters  
at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny  
the year is 1869  
several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine )  
president grant sends west and gordon to investigate  
there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana  
west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr  arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate  
as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states  
i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point  
this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess  
i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly  
there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy  
as i said , the fault is totally that of the script  
when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done  
the leads could've been played samuel l  jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful  
no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like "" bye bye , mr  knife guy ! "" 
sound good  
still , this film has a lot going for it visually  
the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy

-1,"synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur  
unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way  
comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television )  
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband )  
other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable  
stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do  
interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen  
after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears  
the narrator states that "" this is the story of daryl gleason "" and tells the audience that he is the stalker  
of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels  
if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked  
okay  so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required  
stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious  
the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together  
daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her  
ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate  
these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet  
for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked  
stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower )  
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey )  
stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either  
jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much  
he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands  
maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the "" stalked "" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner  
brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed  
toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl  
to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house  
does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ?

-1," "" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd  "" 
actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts  
it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash  
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king )  
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton )  
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche  
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did  
of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche  
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  
judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation  
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society  
when "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  
dramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused  
if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics  
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants  
the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo's "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure )  
some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy  
 "" mandingo "" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 )  
the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 ) "
-1,"robin williams is a comedic genus  
that is , he is one when he's in a film that allows him space to move  
 "" flubber "" straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn't get out  
in a re-make of its own 1961 "" absent minded professor "" , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less  
recycling old films ( "" that darned cat "" , "" 101 dalmatians "" ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared  
professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college  
his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he's left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory  
she's giving him one more chance  
he blows that chance when he invents "" flubber "" ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress  
his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself  
it's not all bad news  
flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it  
brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town's evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry )  
while he's busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald )  
there's a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny  
at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked "" why are these people laughing ? "" 
although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors  
everyone else comes across as half-asleep  
the re-make is successful in that respect  
it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties  
i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years  
there have been some updates  
fred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird  
his faithful dog charlie is now "" weebo "" , the hovering robot  
the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining  
flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality  
the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number  
this has nothing to do with the story  
the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys  
not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem  
there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense "

but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead  
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again  
she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line  
they sacked him after he got sick  
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation  
that actually is the whole storyline  
speed 2 could do without dialogues  
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound  
i don't really know why this is called an action movie  
except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies  
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie  
then desaster strikes  
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around  
i looked for the "" action "" but couldn't find it  
most of the time she is part of the decoration  
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door  
now we know that she can handle a chain saw  
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds  
the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed  
jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water  
his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger  
he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part  
then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster  
he doesn't succeed , though  
an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential  
before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror  
i can't really recommend speed 2  you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny  
especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat "

paul verhoeven's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity  
it stank  
starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore  
it stinks  
nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here's a brief synopsis anyway  
some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy  
after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared  
this involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs' planet  
much carnage ensues  
the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call  
more carnage ensues  
after being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a "" brain bug "" which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans ( look , i didn't write this , ok ? )  
yet more carnage ensues  
get the picture ? 
interspersed throughout all this are brief "" ads "" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven's robocop  
there are many problems with starship troopers  
the plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly  
harris ( star of tv's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a "" brain bug "" later on  
in addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210  
the characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it's ok because she got to sleep with rico  
i had hoped that verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him  
the dialogue is embarassing and isn't helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species )  
finally , the fake "" ads "" become a nuisance  
although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect  
some people will say all of that's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes  
so what about those battle scenes ? 
well , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs  
and people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways  
but this is my problem  
the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards' character vomits on-screen )  
verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly  
while robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features "

-1,"as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients  
he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony  
and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer  
in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal  
his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino )  
he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division  
lomax is soon given the case of his life  
he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide  
the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell  
he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron )  
but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story  
it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed  
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm  
quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago  
freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed  
the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts  
the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer  
the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax  
unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere  
granted , the film is very handsome-looking  
you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino  
you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties  
you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away  
this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot  
as with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst  
in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background  
his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored  
his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known  
pacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie  
there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited "

and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad  
but then when "" analyze this "" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened  
it got great reviews  
critics were proclaiming it "" hilarious "" and a "" dead-on parody of mob movies ""  
well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater  
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? 
well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for  
 "" analyze this "" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted  
don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here  
i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material  
he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama  
if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the "" naked gun "" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful  
as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others  
this doesn't work  
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him  
and the movie is badly paced , too  
it never takes off  
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum  
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script  
it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere  
the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues  
this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie  
i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny  
if "" analyze this "" had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me  
i would have been too busy laughing to notice  
but as it is , i only chuckled a few times  
the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of "" the godfather ""  
sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing  
but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population  
i loathed "" there's something about mary "" , yet loved "" baseketball "" "

in the film , johnson plays    
you guessed it    
a cop  
the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on "" miami vice  "" 
a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life  
beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children  
she will not even allow him to wish them "" merry christmas "" by telephone  
but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang  
beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop  
his investigation starts in l  a  and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp  
virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective  
the plot is incoherent and full of holes  
the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions  
the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense  
i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii  
in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction  
dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting  
according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck  
you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable  
most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above  
william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods  
forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable "
-1,"at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong  
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts  
that's "" dirty work "" in a nutshell  
a very different kind of movie  
this is not a movie that i can easily review  
the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters  
  
  and 
tells me this movie is terrible  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
it's a one note concept  
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in "" happy gilmore "" and "" veronica's closet "" seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend's grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house  
first the critic in me  
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way  
here's the catch  
none of the characters are sympathetic  
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want  
the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people  
there's jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex  
there's even a subplot that's developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest  
and i loved watching it  
i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it  
norm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit  
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job  
the foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don't understand  
how do they get out of it ? 
by admiting they lied on their resumes , and don't know a thing about construction ! 
and surprise , they get fired  
the characters are incredibly mean-spirited  
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying "" if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death "
-1,
-1,"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner  
his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  
hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts  
whichever one you like , dear , he says  
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries  
i liked that scene for two reasons  
first , the cakes looked really cool  
second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  
it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely )  
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  
i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy  
case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  
however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  
 ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense  ) 
it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  
well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  
so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  
anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  
the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world  
if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society  
it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  
he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one )  
he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  
he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others  
and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there "

-1,"it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed "" total recall "" before this one )  
if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live  
and this includes keanu reeves  
what do i hate about seagal ? 
i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint )  
i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold's hairpiece in "" boogie nights  "" 
i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights  
i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain  
i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place )  
and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him )  
sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago )  
but the guy makes worse films than reagan did  
so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ? 
well    something 
about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight  
i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! )  
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off  
i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ? 
so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy  
and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film  
but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister )  
and forsythe more than once threatens his family  
at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in "" the shining "" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away )  
seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee  
he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of "" catch , "" when he's conveniently called away on assignment  
i dunno about you , but playing "" catch "" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares  
he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he's unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue  
serves them right  
this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don't appear to be in this film  
i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly  
i know this guy can act : he was awesome in "" raising arizona "" as goodman's partner in crime "
-1,"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels  
first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  
but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  
no no    
just kidding  
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games  
the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants )  
the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  
unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game  
i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve  
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  
and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office  
mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  
shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid  
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now  "" 
too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie  
i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 
 * the acting is truly bad  
sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie )  
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder  
in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  
i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness  
 * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again "
-1,
-1," ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair  
elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth  
tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth  
also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother  
while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one  
the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all  
only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters  
and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not  
the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements  
mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame  
the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good  
she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist  
robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money  
elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i  e  
flipper , 1996 )  
his role is also vastly underwritten  
morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role  
like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money  
the supporting cast are all o  k , none making much of an impression  
ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? 
well , yes and no  
although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects  
sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all  
surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister  
in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity  
what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects  
the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect  
once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie  
let's hope armageddon is a bit better "
-1,"my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration  
as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed  
sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? 
then there's "" caligula  "" 
this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc  this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time  
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining  
after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  
no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes )  
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time  
 "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or 
so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  
the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place )  
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die    so he kills him and ascends to the throne  
then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off  
the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity  
but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like  
oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ? 
and that they killed people so disgustingly ? 
and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not  
i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up  
and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time  
the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this  
but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark  
the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life  
not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus  
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow  
there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so "
-1,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel ""  
nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away  
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience

-1,"mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla  
his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have  
joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars  
during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , "" wow  
that's some ape  "" 
joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla  
he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people  
he picks things up and stares at them pensively  
he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness  
joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes  
as a character , he doesn't quite register  
and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come  
the words "" family entertainment "" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart  
the picture is a remake of the 1949 film  
it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters  
the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas  
as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife  
specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood  
soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother  
so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers  
in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla )  
and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother  
jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother  
this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film  
the movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla  
but the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals  
the movie also has bad dialogue  
if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like "" joe isn't happy ! "" 
and "" joe isn't safe here ! "" 
 "" we need to get joe out of here ! "" 
 "" joe is way too big for that cage ! "" 
i don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close  
as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage )  
paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them "
-1," "" from the director of "" the nightmare before christmas "" it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million  
to each it's own however , since "" monkey bone "" is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made  
a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects  
stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena "" monkey bone "" a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder  
when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you'll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i'm guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life  
people are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them  
when stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can't stand ) he tries to keep him under control  
making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life  
when monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body  
now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares    or 
something like that  
rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) "" monkey bone "" had potential in the script and even the story  
what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development  
for instance we really don't get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? 
kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her  
the cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body  
bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast  
dave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as "" will & grace's "" megan mullally who can be funny  
the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust  
the special effects of "" monkey bone "" is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes  
some of them are believable and some unbelievable    for 
monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don't realize that he is animated    but 
on occasion it sneaks up on you  
the direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff  
it's too bad really , "" monkey bone "" could have been a real good movie , but with it's heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role "
-1,"it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters  
this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd    "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations  
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla  
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  
sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence  
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype    ) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip  
people die  
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick  
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain  "" 
it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  
no dice , bueller  
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint  
every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it  
as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
broderick is invaluable to the government  
he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members  
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard  
 "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes  
 "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again  
it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more  
meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love  
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer "

-1,"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it  
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence  
i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it  
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began  
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film  
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous  
it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex  
it's a suspense film with no suspense  
it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden  
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself  
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally  
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends  
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject  
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes )  
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people  
so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it  
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense  
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg  
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting  
he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out  
evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work  
rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization  
and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained  "" 
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening  
they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures  
the doctor responsible for all this , dr  caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film )  
much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act "

-1,"some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it  
thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story  
it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) 
when rubin was only ten  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison  
to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives  
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education  
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin's autobiography  
immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra "" sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us  "" 
hmmm  
after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  
of course , we're already told that he's innocent  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version  
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it  
it's almost cruel  
the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity  
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists  
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie  
it's formula stripped to the bare necessities  
you have your wrongly accused black man  
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene  
but there's nothing else  
you'd expect some sort of involving investigation  
but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence "
-1,"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon  
as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque  
the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style "" chance brushstrokes  "" 
starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  
the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections  
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man  
daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer  
when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex  
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed  
he thinks that francis's paintings have "" no bloody use , "" and the movie presents no counterargument  
writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma  
we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's "" amorality and innocence  "" 
francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often  
 "" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , "" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match  
as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood  
francis appears to be in complete ecstasy  
another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities  
as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience  
in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident  
francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy  
sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful  
 ( "" i'm optimistic by nature  
i'm optimistic about nothing  "" 
 "" loneliness is my only true companion  "" ) 
we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself  
he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth  
full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom  
mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly  
like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling "
-1,"in our time  
in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man'  
and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic  
in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away  
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry  
the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese  
the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered  
the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers  
it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death  
escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate  
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty  
the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy   
there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production  
and there are more problems besides its title  
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece  
we call it 'modernization'  
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights  
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing  
kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature  
and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare  
i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing  
i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing  
he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision  
unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments  
his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow  
the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified  
jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice  
their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act  
they are nothing more than two celebrities put together "

-1,"the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes  
alas , it refers to our heroes ! 
as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further  
after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one  
but the human race doesn't have much to worry about  
after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus  
she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus )  
they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters  
lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board  
the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship  
soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened  
finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! 
it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! 
virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation  
when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene  
it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising  
i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative  
virus takes itself seriously  
and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming  
but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out  
okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity  
they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that )  
on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people  
after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around  
the leader , of course , is a big creature  
every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around  
virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening  
it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there  
on one level , virus is almost passable fun  
it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films )  
there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting )  
the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie  
it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing "

-1,"in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america  
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question  
instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind  
 "" in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "" 
he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked  
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws  
perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage  
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy  
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however  
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her  
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding  
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner )  
through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage  
and he has to ask to borrow clothing  
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down  
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes  
greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to  
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law  
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship  
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films  
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived  
too many coincidences in the story work against greg  
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky  
certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him  
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy  
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written  
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance  
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can  
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities  
but we do not really see much of that digging  
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen "
-1,"what a contrast ! 
in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly  
i'm not sure you could get two more different movies  
while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it  
this is one interesting movie  
it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty  
there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men  
hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him  
his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? 
and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? 
 "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen  
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? 
this is not a movie for answers  
donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions  
that's what makes this movie stay on your mind  
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time  
even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do  
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly  
i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this  
eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable  
i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him  
chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person  
i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend  
everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real  
it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world  
unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men  
i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing  
first , it's depressing that such a world exists  
a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings  
sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background  
second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world  
where are the stories about women's world ? 
not the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men  
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts  
it's very talkative , intelligent and static "
-1,"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller  
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may  
both those films were tense exercises in chills  
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer  
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively  
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed  
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot  
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay  
the thrills all came from the plot  
ronin is like a film made by another man  
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it  
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j  d  zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure  
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai  
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west  
if you miss the opening , do not worry  
this film will explain again what a ronin is  
sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin  
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer  
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france  
sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case  
dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case  
sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting )  
also along is larry ( skipp suddeth )  
the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise  
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team  
the story is not very easy to follow  
it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom  
somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case "
-1,"the classic story & the production which ruined it 
marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h  g  wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel  
of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title   )  
the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea  
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr  moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize  
his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress  
even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal "" people  "" 
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr  moreau their maker  
using shock-therapy and the law , dr  moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled  
the island of dr  
moreau questions the ability of men playing god  
dr  moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence    but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long  
moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp  
even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it  
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not "" prioritized "" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes     rather 
ungloriously at times too  
perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations "
-1,"sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood )  
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne )  
watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but the plot's a joke  
there's no logic at work here  
tone is also an issue--there is none  
director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say  
is it a statement on human rights ? 
is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? 
glimcher never tells  
instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience won't notice what's missing  
just awful

then check out his oscar- nominated work in the madness of king george , still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill  
stage director nicholas hytner , in a remarkable screen debut , has adapted alan bennett's 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect

a man of no importance 98 min  
/ rated "" r "" ====================== 
in suri krishnamma's a man of no importance , albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it's a shame when the film gets so serious around him  
his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde  
he reads to his riders , and once a year , with their help , he tries to stage one of the author's plays  
this year it's "" salome  "" 
for about an hour , there's a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs  
conflict arises , but it's small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there  
but with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story  
where things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride  
the twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney's character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before  
it's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doesn't send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity  
it's just a turn off

-1,"warning : spoilers are included in this review    
but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film   "
-1,"`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor  
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter  
i chuckled incessantly , all the way home  
let me share  
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college )  
luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report  
despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization  
soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account  
yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? 
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable  
the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense  
unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting  
it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars     
but not the script  
`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  
first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm  
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar  
will they never take this watch off ? 
and what if they forget it by their bedside ? 
perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed  
on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters  
gee , why not member t-shirts ? 
but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions  
they are given official skull paddles  
when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal  
facing the opposite way means a disagreement  
wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? 
hell no  
they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong  
i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest  
the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout  
but not entirely "

-1,"if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep  
if it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week  
if it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs  
if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez  
 ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip  
for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup  
this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective  ) 
snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater  
snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? 
if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? 
is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? 
will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? 
and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? 
the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer  
if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate  
the trailer is a work of sheer genius  
it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot  
the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross  
 ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) 
but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie  
the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match  
unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot  
the trailer gives away much , too much of the story  
the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy  
the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is  
without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level  
as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit  
de palma is maddeningly inconsistent  
he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way )  
on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain )  
snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value  
the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor  
there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done  
this is what's called giving the devil his due  
but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie  
placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years "
-1,"written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni 
directed by terry gilliam 
i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last  
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose  
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out  
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag  
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s  thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  
operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr  
gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers  
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  
dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax  
and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead  
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view  
thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document  
it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy  
it's a cheech and chong movie  
you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down  
there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard  
this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes  
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen  
but to what end ? 
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations  
but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work  
this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong "
-1,"summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money  
wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies  
will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses  
he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing  
west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr  loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache  ) 
before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives  
there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough  
there's also a pleasant soundtrack  
buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes  
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see  
apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works  
firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money  
one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise  
both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end  
not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy  
therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious  
the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing  
she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith  
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character  
the 'humour' in the film is also very off  
will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display  
the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk  
it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself  
it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably  
the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness  
there's also problems with the plot  
jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill  
plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly  
the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built "

normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be  
but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg  
i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all  
maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny  
in mine , it's not  
or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking  
because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one  
at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing  
brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it  
wrong mel ! 
i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere  
this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad  
he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out  
but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them  
the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr  
 ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name  ) 
lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave  
hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass  
it's just too funny  
racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? 
oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk  
i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head  
but i digress  
anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word  
golly , will the hilarity just never end ? 
he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west  
together , they save the day from evil  
not one person in this movie gives a decent performance  
wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie  
ok , he really didn't -- but he should have  
the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day  
i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience "
-1,"1  he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2  he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3  
his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression  
in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good  
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful  
one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery  
as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers  
unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy  
to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture  
firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot  
the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively  
we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people  
during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive  
flash-forward a year  
now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn )  
but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual  
a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom  
led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border  
along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis )  
eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy  
firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good  
unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen  
these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game  
the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating  
everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions  
there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat  
as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache  
he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero  
my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume "

it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  
but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film  "" 
but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated  
thus , the curse of the "" event film  "" 
 "" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation )  
but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well , this kid is the "" event film "" in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama  
one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 
now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls  
and "" independence day "" has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars  "" 
i mean , isn't that devil's den ? 
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in "" striptease  "" 
they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men  
i mean , come on  
the aliens in "" 2001 "" were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! 
basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful  
okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly  
now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  
yep  
these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too  
they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later  
the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered "

-1,"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect  
woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room "
-1,"i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question  
let's say you've just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious  
your friends have left to go get help , and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up  
a tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on  
he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck  
do you : 
a ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , 
b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? 
if you answered "" a "" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" and will likely hate this movie  
however , if you answered "" b "" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! 
 "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" is being called a sequel , but it's really more of a remake of the original  
there's a few changes here and there , but it's essentially the same ( even the infamous "" meathook "" scene has been re-created  ) 
the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere  
needless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family  
much carnage ensues  
to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly  
in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere  
it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel  
no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel  
the dialogue is even more atrocious  
zellwegger , who is kidnapped by "" the family "" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people  
when you're surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window  
speaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window  
apparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window  
the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn't * get caught in the window  
this was one of many glaring inconsistencies  
there are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long  
the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey  
he plays a member of "" the family "" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can't help but be amazed by his performance  
he obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows  
he makes jack nicholson's portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in "" the shining "" look restrained in comparison  
for a horror movie , "" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation "" contains surprisingly little gore  
in fact , in contains none  
there's a little blood here and there , but that's as far as it goes "
-1," "" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club  "" 
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning  
director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge  
with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out  
this just goes to show that hype kills  
it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception  
the story goes like this  
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter )  
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended  
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain  
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse  
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt )  
the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight  
how do they come up with this stuff ? 
anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed  
out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message  
fincher shows us that society is like robots  
we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out  
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others  
call me crazy , but this is common knowledge  
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably  
even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story  
i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp  
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention  
i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself  
his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee  
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more  
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose  
she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left  
this continues for what seems like 6 hours  
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end "
-1,"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air  
sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  
even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i  
as what would happen if sgt  
joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic  
in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters  
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  
the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying  
this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot  
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d  i  
gives us more -- much more  
webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself  "" 
 ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered  ) 
this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell  
for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his  
i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about    
 "" now you listen to me , youngster  
someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness    
i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there "
-1,"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable  
as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon  
rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type  
gloria is her latest disaster  
babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best  
janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles  
gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture  
after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press  
it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed  
as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement  
she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth  
she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast  
an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky  
just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice  
 "" be a man , "" his father lectures him sternly  
 "" don't trust nobody  
not no broads  
nobody  "" 
most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements  
add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones  
lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting  
they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse  
 ( "" say you're my baby , "" kevin coos demandingly  
 "" i'm not gonna , "" gloria pouts back  ) 
the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites  
the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him  
and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied  
gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys  
think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? 
if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film  
you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face "
-1,"it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends  
still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown  
she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club  
everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand  
in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway  
to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean  
however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends  
julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr  ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal  
needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island  
accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie  
but was this contest too good to be true ? 
the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects  
meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin  
this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island  
eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms  
as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook  
julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing "" i will survive "" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll "" i still know    "" ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia  
but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life  
the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming  
this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness  
there isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths  
here's an appropriate example  
knock-knock  
 "" housekeeping "" , says the diminuitive cleaning lady  
the door suddenly opens up  
slash  
next victim ! 
is there any reason to go and see this movie ? 
not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes "
-1,"i still can't figure out why people went in droves to see this movie  
now before you go assuming i'm some sort of high brow snob , who can't appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor  
i thought there's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998  
low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component  
i wanted to like the waterboy , i really did  
i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie  
actually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that  
not a great record for a 90-minute film  
the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies  
those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material  
nothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film  
it's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny  
i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents  
if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live  
most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry  
sandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team  
the team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field  
you can figure out the rest from here  
sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star  
as i said , the film had a great deal of potential  
the idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast  
all of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material  
even sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material  
even as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film  
but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about  
if their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie  
fairuza balk plays sandler's leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time  
winkler is great as the coach who uses a "" coaching for dummies "" -style book to help him get through games  
the real standout though , is kathy bates  
even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler's overprotective and overbearing mama "
-1,"ahh yes  
the teenage romance  
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl  
and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity  
along now comes `down to you'  
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr  attached and all  
only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above  
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to  
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing  
in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr  ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles )  
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies  
from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story  
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that     
well , only happen in the movies  
fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal  
freddie prinze jr  and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around  
zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue  
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' )  
even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray'  
maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd  
as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely  
perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny  
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired  
the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience "
-1,"writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) 
starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso 
i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr  cameron's early works  
in fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future  
no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him  
in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget  
the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter's twisted remake of "" the thing  "" 
 "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water  
they get on  
they break up into pairs and investigate  
and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha )  
not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters  
of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper  
and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn  
i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed  
like anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo 'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance )  
or peter o'toole in "" caligula  "" 
great actor , horrific performance  
it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film  
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects    if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them  
 "" virus "" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , "" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable  "" 
and if you don't believe me , go back and rent "" godzilla , "" and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it )  
but all of this doesn't matter since "" virus "" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie  
the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it )  
imagine the first attack of the aliens in "" aliens , "" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of "" virus "" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members  
and my god , it's a long damn sit  
with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made  
we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like "" out of sight "" and "" saving private ryan "" give you more faith in them , but movies like "" virus "" manage to drain a little more out of the pool "
-1,"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 
regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words  
you have to see it and experience it for yourself  
here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so  
yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  
in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  
don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off  
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme  
it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark  
as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  
now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess  
i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off  
for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing  
i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap )  
i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film  
ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem  
rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film  
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 
in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  
in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  
but what a strange mess it is  
it was written by stephen e  de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours  
can this be the same man ? 
i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time  
knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here  
for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong  
why ? 
who knows  
what are the implications of this ? 
i have no idea  
most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem  
knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut  
the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity "

-1,"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy  
there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group  
this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core  
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998  
i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch  
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story  
what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it  
using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once  
that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex  
both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?  
the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat  
the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound  
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on )  
the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs  
kevin bacon ) is familiar with  
the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life  
that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script  
it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker  
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment )  
quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws  
the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school  
a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him  
one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn  
after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) "
-1,"in the james bond film "" diamonds are forever , "" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads  
bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match  
well , collars and cuffs don't match in "" the real blonde  "" 
what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen  
the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin  
it plays like an "" ally mcbeal "" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary "" fantasy "" sequences  
writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea  
it isn't  
the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary  
matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent  
he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas  
 "" that's not really acting "" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex  
but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video  
but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after "" showgirls "" )  
this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes  
dicillo has referred to "" the real blonde "" as "" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff    "" 
the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting  
catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant "" living in oblivion "" ) , is at her most annoying in "" the real blonde  "" 
look at her closely ; she really can't act at all  
her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars  
she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations  
she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much  
she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks  
maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a "" natural "" blonde  
bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera "" passion crest "" --stiff and uninteresting  
maybe that's the point  
daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera  
hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 ) "
-1,"chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying  
i think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in "" the fifth element "" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle "" money talks "" just doesn't do him service  
tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie  
in fact , if you see "" money talks , "" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of "" toy story "" 's writers penned the sloppy script  
tucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen )  
after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael )  
but villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo  
the local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture  
he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview  
this means james must present his new "" friend "" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino )  
and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james  
 "" this ain't no buddy movie , "" claim the print ads  
yeah , right  
actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears "" money talks "" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker  
this is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role  
but you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing "" money talks "" has going for it  
and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make  
it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with "" money talks  "" 
the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when "" nothing to lose "" employed it last month  
everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers  
the villains , as many as there are , are dull  
certain story elements are too coincidental  
and too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight  
a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( "" you brought a killer into my parents' house ! "" ) 
is extremely silly  
you get the picture  
obviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at "" money talks  "" 
but the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health )  
but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics  
tucker's audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like "" money talks  "" 
those who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails "
-1,"you would think that this film's dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and "" americanizing "" it

now how or why mr  bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can't even describe how the film explains it  
the point is that mr  bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble  
problems problems problems , where to begin ? 
first , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from "" beetlejuice "" or one note away from the score from "" rob roy ""  
then , the song choices are totally uninspired  
 "" good vibrations "" ? 
 "" i love l  a  "" ? 
wow , don't put any thought into that guys  
also , bean makes way too much noise in the film  
the character doesn't speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr  bean  
each episode was like a chaplin silent movie  
in the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc  it's annoying , and just plain wrong for the character  
the main problem though is that it's just not funny  
with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes  
multiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease  
they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series  
sad , and creatively lazy  
as a series , "" mr  bean "" only ran for about 13 episodes or so  
why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? 
13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn't exhausted all possible situations  
all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it's almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn't for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr "

-1,"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning  
based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros  a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west  
but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again  
and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects  
i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? 
the answer is just about everything  
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate  
there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression  
but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it  
at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting  
will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series  
my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved  
smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him  
he's too much of a joker  
i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible  
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office  
the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists  
the trail leads to the diabolical dr  arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent  
loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns  
one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right  
the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings  
unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem  
wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works  
most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival  
if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered  
kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot  
salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon  
branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film  
but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top "

i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad , there might be the same elements present  
coincidence ? 
poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau )    he is about to marry his radiant fiancee , laura ( cameron diaz )  
but before he exchanges his vows , he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout  
but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get  
the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere  
the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time  
a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found  
although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends  
one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated  
whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases  
or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family  
another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death  
he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well  
boyd is the ? doer' of the group  
seemingly suffering from a long psychosis , when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed , he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks  
kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura's demanding expectations  
then , there's moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face  
the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy , but it presents things in a manner that just aren't funny  
drugs , mutilation , and killing your own friends isn't something to be laughed at  
as a straight psychological drama , i could see how it might have worked , as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways  
but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours  
if you do like this movie , i don't think that i want to know you  
i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play  ' 
and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee  
but her talents are essentially wasted here  
it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone "

starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth  
rated r  
summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities  
lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg  
but here , he gets himself into a bind  
his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work  
the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city  
it was the hottest summer on record  
to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population  
so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city  
the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters  
we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings  
vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her  
ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more "" eccentric , "" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend  
tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again  
a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects  
at the top of the list is ritchie  
vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend  
as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded "" so what ? "" 
question springs to mind  
from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find  
lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement  
all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable  
too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here  
frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour  
there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague  
leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny  
the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy  
you'd never guess from his performance  
adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better "

these treats are great relief from the summer heat  
in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment  
i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat  
this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat  
in this film , they are no where to be found  
what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula  
two men are asked to stop this threat  
one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents  
among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest  
the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating  
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act  
for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with  
 "" now touch my breast , "" west says  
gordon does so and then softly coos his approval  
i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness  
the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter  
i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith  
could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ? 
it was as if the director was yelling "" will smith , do your own thing    and 
action ! "" 
here's an example  
in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people  
he must endear himself to the crowd to escape  
the director yells , "" will smith , do your own thing    and 
action ! "" 
in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades

you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence  
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys  
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves  
all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office  
the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking  
the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' 
the writing behind this project is embarrassing  
for your amusement , i will explain the plot  
dr  kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr  heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on  
as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences  
when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler  
kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team  
there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! 
 ( a far superior film in any league )  
you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene  
sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics  
question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? 
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers  
it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula  
i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors  
the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny  
the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute'  
i suppose they are  
i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute  
other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script  
there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines  
peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast  
then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid  
meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha )  
i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs "
-1,"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981  
monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party  
everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things  
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all  
this disappointed me greatly  
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion  
lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd  
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin  
she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent  
there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie  
when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party  
at the bar , he runs into two more girls  
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names  
ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance  
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad  
christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie  
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost  
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night  
this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent  
hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good  
she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress  
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr  
jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't  
kate hudson is a huge klutz  
she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie "

-1,"well , here's a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release  
after just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? 
it is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was  
at least some smut would have livened things up a bit  
 "" porky's , "" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid  
women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet )  
their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's  
after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building  
for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's  
 "" porky's , "" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level  
as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough  
as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat  
as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave  
and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore  
one of the most offensive things about , "" porky's , "" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers  
the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool  
that sure is revealing information  
the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark  
the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people  
for example , the two gym teachers , mrs  balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of  
mrs  balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog  
there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating  
to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80's films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison  
any of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984's "" sixteen candles , "" or , 1985's "" the breakfast club , "" put , "" porky's , "" at an even greater shame  
those films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing  
and heck , if , "" porky's , "" wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i'd take 1982's "" fast times at ridgemont high , "" or 1982's "" the last american virgin , "" over this any day of the week  
director bob clark is not a bad director  
two years after he made , "" porky's , "" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , "" a christmas story  "" 
i would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay "
-1,
-1,"the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film  
it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction  
that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller  
the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense  
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u  s  army's criminal investigation division  
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation  
complicating the case is the fact that capt  campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee  
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in  
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid  
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems  
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze  
director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw  
it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them  
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans  
west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter  
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits  
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell  
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods )  
there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another  
indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? "" )  
even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers  
goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies  
dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script  
it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye )  
by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun  
it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five  
goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine "
-1,"i am a steven seagal fan  
i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things  
any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on  
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine  
not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull  
in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest  
he's also put on quite a lot of weight  
small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? 
 ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later )  
as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past  
while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole  
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing  
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons  
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en )  
it's the other changes that disappoint  
for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour  "" 
wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest  
as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching  
a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble  
he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies  
again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual  
heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film  
is that a lot to ask of the seague ? 
too much  
seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone  
not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think  
no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows  
that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else  
we trusted him  
we got to know him  
now , betrayal  
i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again "

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather "

-1,">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong  
at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world  
courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school  
everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity  
courtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group  
it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz  
just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else  
and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie  
and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth  
this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school  
>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing  
not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast  
judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has  
also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers  
on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996's scream  
mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film  
she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her  
faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles  
when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles  
gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker  
jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in  
we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film  
the beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help  
during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion  
nothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again  
jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat  
the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang  
all in all , a horrible disappointment  
the bottom line : the tagline reads , "" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside  "" 
yes , that is too true "
-1,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
it's confounding  
i can't believe a film can be this bad  
and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself  
while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  
on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted )  
but the film fails fundamentally in execution  
every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  
take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus  
we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad  
later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  
and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad  
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  
real drama is character-based  
you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it  
we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness  
real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry "

-1,"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england  
the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects  
more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character  
even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive  
although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive  
the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure  
if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980  
and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing  
well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film  
but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary  
with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens  
you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint  
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen  
but john , it just wasn't scary  
i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me  
actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films  
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me  
it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material  
call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it  
i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up  
werewolf bites boy ( david naughton )  
boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy  
including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital  
the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse  
i know it sounds strange , but it actually works  
the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie  
as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects  
while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film  
and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch  
actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way "

-1,"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life  
i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves  
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  
a little imagination goes a long way  
in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him  
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions  
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned  
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  
what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional  
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help  
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills  
part of this is a result of the film's slow pace  
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill  
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  
big deal , we've seen it all before  
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck  
now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement  
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  
you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  
the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  
the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us  
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening  
even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  
unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through "

-1,"i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone  
sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out  
the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff  
hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in  
clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time  
and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it  
one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it  
nothing could be further from the truth  
i went into the theater expecting to love the movie  
the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters  
almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way  
when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement  
so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter  
i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway  
what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever  
and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like  
where to begin in criticizing this movie ? 
the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever  
there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence  
zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero  
so why does this movie get one star out of me ? 
well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub  
and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get  
alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party  
and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does )  
as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too )  
the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath  
they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party  
not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy  
at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated  
in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it  
so you can't call it a sex flick "
-1,"capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems  
the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television  
the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent  
this is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
jalla ! jalla ! 
is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen  
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love  
the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park  roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background  
they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs  
roro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem  
roro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems  
it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny )  
yasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either  
mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence  
the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other  
mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers  
the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them  
roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding  
not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected  
the plot turns in several places are contrived  
one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen  
lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer  
when things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story  
for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film  
characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function  
we do see some of roro's family life and his concerns  
that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director  
while the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film  
it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life  
one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this "

the camera zooms in incredibly close  
it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate  
all of a sudden , with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse , the doors swing open to reveal what's inside  
close-up thrill-shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear , which is a pretty good sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned  
rather , you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in , that you stop caring about who lives , who dies and where the story goes  
instead , you become more interested in how the characters get killed off  
the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray - two couples and dear friends to one another  
during the summer just after high school graduation , they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway  
suddenly , without warning , their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision  
fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess , they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again  
a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change  
relationships fizzle , future dreams crumble , and attitudes change  
but , they can not forget what they did  
and apparently , neither can someone else  
someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : "" i know what you did last summer  "" 
the letter-writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens  
it's now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it's too late  
while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best  
there is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills  
it could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders  
it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film  
it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don't walk towards them yelling "" hello ""  
once you yell "" hello "" , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  
it's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's about to happen "
-1,"hollywood never fails to astound me  
every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool  
i was truly convinced that "" wild wild west "" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes "" end of days "" to prove me wrong  
this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects  
the result ? 
nothing but groans and yawns  
even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept  
at the very least , "" end of days "" should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that  
it's just lousy  
arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and "" batman & robin , "" plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something  
along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from "" friends "" ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo  
it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 )  
if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , "" the chosen one , "" their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat  
ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house  
the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p  m  and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky )  
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary  
you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil  
a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl  
arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression  
and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own  
oh , the anguish ! 
oh , the humanity ! 
oh , the writing ! 
andrew w  marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character  
cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first "" lethal weapon , "" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter  
twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling  
when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter  
in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter  
subtle , marlowe , subtle  
speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying  
hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions "
-1,"well i guess it's that time of the year again  
the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions  
it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  
in america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year  
and maybe it's the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like "" consider this a divorce , "" "" hasta la vista , baby , "" and "" you're the disease  
i'm the cure "" actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs  
this is not entirely a bad thing , of course  
what am i talking about ? 
i'm talking about the summer "" blockbusters , "" the "" action thrillers , "" the "" this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go "" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects  
in the rash of "" my , what big guns you have , but wait ! 
mine are bigger "" movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of "" save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats "" offerings  
i'm talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc  this year i'm talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser  
here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of "" my explosion is more real-looking than yours "" movies , but nothing else  
mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us  
the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation  
that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s  
in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger  
he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities  
his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he's ever relocated , is "" an actual , real life honest person  "" 
because she's so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers  
lee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair  
of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate  
in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have  
it's around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk  
i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about  
it's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls  
it has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim's heart even from great distances  
despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i'm certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun  
instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : "" i'll be back  "" 
like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily  
although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas "
-1,"you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the "" odd couple ii "" sneak preview  
they were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered  
 "" what a great movie , "" exclaimed one gent at the urinal , "" everything was so true ! "" 
 "" yeah , "" laughed a man standing next to him , "" i drive as slow as that one guy did  
my kids give me holy hell for it ! "" 
 "" and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , "" chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife  
if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" may be just the film for you  
others will likely be less charitable  
while "" the odd couple ii "" is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt  
simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri  
the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years  
the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport  
they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of "" wacky "" adventures on the road  
jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob  
while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : "" grumpy old men , "" "" grumpier old men "" and "" out to sea  "" 
still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch  
matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons  
lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of "" phnah ! 
phnah ! "" 
despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together  
unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom  
one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club  
if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements  
burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot  
between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs  
i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing  
i came up with four "" god-damns , "" three "" shitheads "" and two "" fucks  "" 
the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word  
it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise  
one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held  
at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word "" san  "" 
the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing  
one of the oldest maxims of film-going is "" beware of movies that use the author's name in the title  "" 
 "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" is no exception to the rule "

-1,"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year  
earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs  
and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies  
starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend  
besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience  
at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber  
after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb  
with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making  
a timeless epic it is not  
besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands  
on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery  
there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne )  
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective  
jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard  
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast  
jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost  
quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble  
the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions  
faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience'  
all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful  
the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart'  
there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier  
even his fellow troopers are petrified  
`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story  
almost too 90's , it seems  
there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' 
sprinkled throughout the screenplay  
i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened  
there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly  
it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does  
the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive "
-1,"writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s  
yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8  5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 )  
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing  
and guess what ? 
he succeeds once again ! 
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems  
it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients  
critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
it is a drama  
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not  
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there  
now on to my review  
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was    he 
missed ! 
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible  
it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep  
i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks  
first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin  
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit  
this kept me interested in watching him at least  
number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school  
and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama  
and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person  
a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless  
if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , 
wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good  
other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab  
even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while  
well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! 
oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating  
anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist  "

joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them "

now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human  
caine volunteers for this risky experiment  
but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong  
while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower  
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania  
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine  
soon every sense of decency is forgotten  
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody  
though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely  
this is a very silly production  
laughable , actually  
apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far  
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected  
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie  
being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society  
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences  
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about  
all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat  
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man  
but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there "
-1,"in french , the phrase "" film noir "" literally means "" black film  "" 
webster defines it as "" a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music  "" 
classic film noir , including such memorable fare as "" the big sleep , "" the original "" cape fear , "" and orson welles' striking "" a touch of evil , "" employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre  
color came into play with neo-noir films like "" chinatown "" and "" blade runner  "" 
 "" l  a  confidential , "" easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking  
for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's "" palmetto  "" 
based on "" just another sucker , "" a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , "" palmetto "" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance  
director volker schlondorff ( "" tin drum , "" the handmaid's tale "" ) stated "" we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy  "" 
it shows  
 "" palmetto "" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy  
the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison  
someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a "" reward "" for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto  
bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto  
while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth  
harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket  
no problem , though  
the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry  
rhea needs "" a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom "" for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny  ) 
the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar "" ransom "" from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam  
things go wrong , of course  
odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks  
in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d  a  's 
office  
they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job  
not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone  
the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further  
as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic "

-1,"it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise  
the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying  
osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt  
not that there's anything wrong with scatology  
i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was  
it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable  
you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn  
osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho  
the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes  
adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing  
osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby  
the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe  
he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower  
frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you  
he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does  
frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground  
it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth  
nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth  
like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one  
after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences  
here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne )  
basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre  
and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click  
it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations  
the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus  
after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn't look fluish  "" 
and the jokes don't rise above that level  
the live action scenes are no better  
frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child  
he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters "
-1,
-1,"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work  
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
with teaching mrs  tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope  
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  
and what a shame that is  
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
teaching mrs  tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren  
mrs  tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils  
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink  
in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work  
the plot is a big problem here  
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director  
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship  
but typical mrs  tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable  
later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs  tingle's final exam  
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it  
alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning "
-1,"jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today  
from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances  
on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong  
and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality  
hush is one such example  
lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium  
the film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama  
we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love  
jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange )  
the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs  
soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm )  
once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives  
as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war  
hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending )  
this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks  
frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire )  
meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object  
as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn  
here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle  
of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation  
maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus  
martha is , of course , the evil one  
how do we know she's evil ? 
she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work  
on the other hand , helen is a good girl  
the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents  
that's about it for character development  
beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists  
however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying  
i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion  
either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script "
-1," "" varsity blues "" is the best film of 1999 thus far  
unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999  
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999  
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game  "" 
by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? 
will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? 
will the team win the climactic game ? 
do cats bathe themselves regularly ? 
the so-called "" hero "" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town  
at least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming  
heck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before  
when the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter )  
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the "" bad guy "" )  
worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game  
the plotting of "" varsity blues "" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book  
admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained  
throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's "" all the right moves  "" 
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's "" dawson's creek "" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities  
while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and "" by-the-numbers "" screenplay by w  peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in "" all the right moves  "" 
the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama  
the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence  
smart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions  
it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts  
the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football  
john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance  
his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that  
his mother stands beside her "" big , strong husband "" and is a passive female  
finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional  
saving "" varsity blues "" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me  
the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to  
but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? 
i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood  
do we really need another high-school sports film ? 
no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films  
 "" varsity blues , "" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts "
-1," "" something is fishy in the state of universal  "" 
about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies  
we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on  
to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim  
most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane  
 ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget  ) 
now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter  
 ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea  ) 
the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script  
the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through  
in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now  
the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet  
the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy  
somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis  
enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back  
we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola  
the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland  
played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing  
his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny  
the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner  
he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet  
very little is done with this  
the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown  
 ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on    ) 
i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves  
but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! 
this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey  
at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make  
the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx "
-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary "
-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros  made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere  
this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture  
and with good reason  
this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit  
remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin  
 ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes  ) 
uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage  
unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship  
at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr  fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days  
the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot  
when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs  peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent  
if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt  
the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption  
 ( they also sip a lot of tea  ) 
overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds  
the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling  
mr  connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest  
at least it all looks good  
this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt  
in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain  
there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates  
by the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre  
not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year  
it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining "

review by : geoff berkshire 
jawbreaker is the very definition of a "" rip-off  "" 
this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s

liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning  
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her  
they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body )  
courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her  
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to  
in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students  
up until about this point the film is effective enough  
however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull  
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch  
courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second  
meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot  
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ )  
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid  
fern's rise to popularity is equally lame  
we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section  
it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him  
it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense  
stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting  
william katt and p  j  soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman  
at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer  
the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look "

-1,"there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime  
really , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it  
with anime , a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two , and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword  
this is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen  
vampire hunter d is a gory , gory film  
if they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx  
it ? s not that it ? s gore is unique - it ? s just like other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc    
it really didn ? t  
it was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was  
it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies  
one evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here  ) 
of course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution  
she gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ? 
it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough  
if it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) 
to fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d )  
the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much  
you see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent  
when he speaks , it ? s in cliches  
heroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated  
later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ? 
will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ? 
in it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original  
the talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo  
and that ? s the best defense i can think of  
i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it  
it ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts  
why ? 
what is the point of that ? 
maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny  
i ? m not a prude , i just don ? t think it ? s warranted  
it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost  
is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower ? 
of course not ? it ? s done for shock  
it ? s tasteless and despicable "

after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel

this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy's worst movie and that's an accomplishment  
remember the golden child , harlem nights ? 
compared to life , they look like citizen kane  
life is long , predictable , foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny  
its 100-minute running time feels like 100 years

you lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used  
and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie

years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second-class people , good for being only maids and servants  
for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved  
but a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies  
in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast-talking , conniving , scam artists or hip-hop , gun-crazy , sex-crazed youths  
both sets of caricatures are demeaning

anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed  
all of the movie's funny scenes were included in the ad  
so what do we get ? 
eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital  
once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife  
his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy  
now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly  
eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them  
both are slow to show concern  
so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james )  
 ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st  bernard for eve to care for  ) 
the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker  
there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life  
sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team  
henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including "" desk set "" and "" there's no business like show business  "" 
 ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry )  
surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream  
the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available  
yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters  
also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial  
eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day  
georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile  
when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream  
i expected to see the credit "" cinematography by 'vanity fair  ' "" 
and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother  
to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off  
the one redeeming aspect of "" hanging up "" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings  
there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant  
my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine "
-1,"54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i , however , would rather cut to the chase  
54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business  
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s  
i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes  
54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining  
it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses  
it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell )  
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  
 ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen  ) 
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  
why his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status )  
there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane  
there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development  
then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! 
this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with )  
campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  
this one doesn't "
-1,"conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made  
that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen

now we're in the nineties  
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather

-1,"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil  
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best "

containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two  
rocky no  1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word    
something that he has not yet successfully achieved  
rocky no  2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace

when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement  
our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight  
the film is divided into two sections  
at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day  
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by  
once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar  
both mr  harrelson and mr  banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here  
mr  harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince  
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable  
mr  banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar  
weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance  
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another  
tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers  
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins  
but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other  
writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed "

i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film  
there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative  
if there was a point to the film , i missed it  
girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers  
the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n  y  actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator  
she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her  
also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington )  
he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him  
her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6  
he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex  
the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring  
it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting  
for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background  
in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting  
of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music  
prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans  
of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy  
he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6  
he should have stuck to acting in this film  
there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up  
there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers  
in that film , they worked to propel the narrative  
in this film , they just made me more confused  
there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become  
other than that , though , nothing much happens  
there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster

no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football  
rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory  
based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought  
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword  
luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film  
antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador  
accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village  
we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude  
they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won  
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land  
help is needed quickly  
an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives  
after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory  
personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity  
nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th  
the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives  
of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors  
but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog  
he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? 
it does not look promising  
these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale  
they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies  
they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon  
the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods  
they are ready to sacrifice their lives  
 "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors  
despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience

with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows  
yet , even tough guys know when to put family first  
as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident  
the police attribute it to heavy drinking  
however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out'  
he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth  
as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters  
they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website  
any one of them may know something about his brother's death  
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed  
but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth

they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at  
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral  
he believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn't die from a dwi accident  
carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid  
his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice  
stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself  
the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death  
he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well  
mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman )  
there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives  
i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible  
i could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all  
i don't like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally  
yes , "" get carter "" is just that complicated and complex  
and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like "" the usual suspects "" for example - just the opposite  
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't remember what had already happened and didn't figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax  
all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn't a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes  
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another  
making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters  
mel gibson starred in "" payback "" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter  
so ultimately "" get carter "" fails for pretty much every selling point it has  
carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not  
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original  
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase )  
in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results "
-1,"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat  
so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut )  
my , how easily does the worm turn  
hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics  
at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included  
and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism    
boring  
although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness  
_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender  
these characters are about as generic as those descriptions  
in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat  
with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best )  
as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_  
what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? 
even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene  
dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault  
from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend  
but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film  
aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored  
shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold  
this tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience  
they fail on both counts  
ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n  
as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience  
too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place  
anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively  
when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots )  
strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying  
there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them "

-1,"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release  
michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof  
the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' )  
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  
these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences  
it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line  
if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words  
but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest  
it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor  
for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk  
wish me luck  
first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport  
while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke  
he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions  
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character  
they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there  
it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis  
but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? 
enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience  
it's stupid , pointless and repetitive  
i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone  
action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited  
and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks  
don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs  
it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced  
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed  
it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure  
coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie  
especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film  
things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat  
if that's not enough for you , there's richard e "

mission to mars 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
there's a world of difference between artists and technicians  
the artist has a vision to create something new  
he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before  
a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox  
obviously successful films need both skills  
brian de palma is a masterful technician  
he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock  
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote  
aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead  
in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick  
to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 ""  
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters ""  
nasa has set its sights for mars  
when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet  
they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe  
and it's all so boring  
there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin  
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching  
error  
the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off  
error  
the alien is laughable  
error  
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable  
error  
there's some nice eyecandy  
the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool  
a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world  
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic  
but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before "

even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times  
comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge  
not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses  
this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess )  
henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey  
 ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films  ) 
how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me  
adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 )  
boston has changed dramatically in those ten years  
it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with "" policia "" printed on their doors  
some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it  
so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him  
that's it  
76 minutes never seemed so long  
this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie  
the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character  
the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight  
a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston  
in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son  
twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot  
in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind  
this fake passport drops to the ground  
lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away  
must not have been a good fake  
this emphasizes another fault with the film  
things just defy common sense  
lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about  
adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for  
i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert "

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
 "" quick , robin ! 
the anti-shark repellant ! "" 
- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg 
i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard  
this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill  
batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss  
by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast  
the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life  
meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone )  
akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement  
it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison  
i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production  
joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance  
there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode  
another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons  
mr  schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective  
it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered  
is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? 
i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously  
 ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" 
each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory  ) 
is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? 
i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is  
arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr  freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be  
mr  schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable  
by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen  
the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! "" 
in the least inventive way  
george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film  
his batman is hardly an imposing figure  
chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all "
-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie  
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion  
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on  
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects  
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie  
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms  zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original  
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones  
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it  
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients  
there really isn't much of a story here  
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with  
and the special effects are great  
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere  
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota  
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe  
but not scary  
then we have the set  
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it  
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route "
-1,"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie  
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock  
i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art  
no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already  
i thought : it's about these two cops  
and they're buddies , sort of  
they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other  
and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots  
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship  
and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying  
and the bad guy is a drug lord  
and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way  
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down  
i only missed the bit about the badges  
the rest i got dead-on  
and i hadn't even left the video store yet  
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo  
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l  is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds  
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man ""  
not funny ; tiresome  
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence  
will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees    
and men in black  
he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself  
martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial  
movies like this are not about originality

-1,"the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z  randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes  
 "" it wasn't me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  
well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either  
fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth  
as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa  
when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void  
  
  
fred  
yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known  
for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park  he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play  
his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records  
overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist  
from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence  
you know , standard kid movie material  
almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role  
we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it  
while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable  
to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny  
why ? 
because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring  
classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy  
stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him  
peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best  
williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory  
as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever  
this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach  
giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times  
the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! 
i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing "

-1,"for "" original sin , "" the road to the screen has been rocky  
initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001  
advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands  
so is "" original sin "" really all that bad ? 
yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards  
the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" )  
more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad  
veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films  
most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the "" let's go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable  
but things are different this summer  
quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may  
 "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls , "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along  
the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , "" mississippi mermaid "" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny  
the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , "" this is not a love story , it is a story about love  "" 
wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers  
a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children  
imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo  
julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face  
luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , "" we have something in common , we are both not to trusted  "" 
after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible  
jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her  
luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded  
his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up  
luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication  
shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck  
finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong  
incidentally , if you're afraid i'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass  
along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie "" 61 * "" ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia  
luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can't have her , he will kill her  
oh , the pathos of it all  
the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly "
-1,
-1,"it should have been a classic  
a great cast of respected supporting actors  
an interesting premise of loser comic book characters  
however , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999  
the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals  
the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise  
the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all  
the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons  
they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film  
 "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business  
but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought  
thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie  
the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy  
the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city  
captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity  
after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured  
it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day  
by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low  
there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention  
the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down  
right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie  
instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr  furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was  
a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work  
another major problem with "" mystery men "" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances  
the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion  
however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way  
to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about  
as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes  
fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of "" american pie "" and "" there's something about mary "
-1,"i'll be the first to admit it  
when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened    i'll 
gonna tell it the way i remember it  "" 
anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult )  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs  joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper )  
the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s  
finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects )  
during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro )  
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film  
and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress  
anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy  
and then the plot moves on  
enter miss havisham    or 
ms  dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft )  
abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  
with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role "

what is the point of this ? 
i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far  
to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace  
wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time  
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight  
many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game  
i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie  
it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though  
freddie prinze jr  stars in the film as christopher blair  
wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie  
this was definitely his worst performance to date  
after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed  
 ( for now anyway  ) 
christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth  
blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there  
his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this  
blair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard  
matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too  
his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie  
the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth  
this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all  
this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on  
the acting is horrible in wing commander  
many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless  
the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it  
the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music  
the special effects are very unrealistic  
when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them  
the explosions look very unrealistic as well "

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however "
-1,"capsule : an insult  
a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes  
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  
it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience  
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely  
it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here  
it's not even fun as trash  
woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police  
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout  
i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking  
see if you can follow this  
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the "" money train "" , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked  
the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout "" halt ! "" 
and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them  
blam , the kid's dead  
then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and    i covered my face  
i'd seen enough  
i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting  
fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train  
hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet  
then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money  
there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it  
neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute  
we do not care about them  
they are not interesting  
they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy  
they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be "

-1,"according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors "" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness  "" 
hmm  
you never know , they just might be on to something  
what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own  
but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it  
it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  
that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  
woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson  
the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  
the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  
it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  
mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand  
then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  
he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  
so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way  
with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's    
dumb and dumber  
yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  
so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen  
get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking  
now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  
the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  
it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together  
some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything  
why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? 
why two of these ? 
why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? 
the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , "" wouldn't that be funny ? ""  
well , no , actually  
the actors don't do the movie much favours either  
woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science "
-1,"ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too  
 "" she's all that "" has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year  
and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad  
 ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad )  
 "" she's all that "" tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr  ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular  
that , right there , is problem #1  
how many times have we seen this storyline ? 
as cook comments near the end of the film , "" it's kind of like "" pretty woman "" , except without the prostitution ""  
of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward  
as it is , though , "" she's all that "" relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead  
there's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured  
the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible  
i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said  
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was  
i was never convinced that she was a "" nerd "" , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary  
the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are  
as for freddie prinze jr  , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here  
he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character  
kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook  
and for some indiscernable reason , he's got hearing aids  
no explanation is given and they're never brought up  
were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ? 
i don't think so  
that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i've seen in a movie in a long time  
 "" she's all that "" sucks  
that's what it boils down to  
it's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer  
the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial  
and what's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens  
it appears to be telling them , "" hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are "
-1,"actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
 "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen  
at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions  
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention  
the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says  
 ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say  ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think )  
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but don't call her "" babe  "" 
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times  
imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term  
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success

sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team  
 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
 "" my name is jerry  
i am happy "" flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad  
deadly beasts appear from nowhere  
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel  
lethal sea snakes attack goodman  
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea ""  
the suspicious scientists turn against each other  
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film  
however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product  
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes  
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification  
it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances  
it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin "

-1,"synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas  
arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five  "" 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube  
 "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either )  
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience  
i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook  
they may as well have huge targets painted on them  
like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief  
unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny  
in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough  
the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film  
several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie  
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? 
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror  
come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something "

-1,"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved  
some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts  
 "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep  
but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while  
it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy  
eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while  
and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be  
 "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series  
that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun  
eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people  
the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch  
in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble  
his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously  
eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way  
murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator  
in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up  
murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor  
the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim  
 "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car  
cars flip  
cars crash  
cars turn over  
and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons  
there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have  
scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning  
of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling  
the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too  
those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality  
the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation  
it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius "
-1,"a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom  
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny  
the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story  
pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face  
the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off  
this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will  
the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook  
to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure  
she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love  
in other words , she has to be in control of things  
in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him  
they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he's a loafer  
one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco  
we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane  
she visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr  ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene  
to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again  
her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show  
you can really write the script from here on by yourself    as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good  
so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again  
he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window  
he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him  
when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he's hired as a regular on the show  
the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national  
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he's a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses  
cliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did  
these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting "

-1,"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list  
what an auspicious beginning ! 
welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l  a  and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere  
firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies  
as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers  "" 
we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan  "" 
having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest  
when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble  
with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles  
not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people  
miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away  
in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building  
as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f  windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face  
our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl  
in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames  
the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse  
this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make  
the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group  
will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? 
she has only seconds to decide who will be saved  
yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway  
not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape  
 ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire  ) 
along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor  
most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing  
he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck  
arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside  
using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust  
when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey "

-1," "" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling  
it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill  
there are certainly better things you can do with your time  
actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments  
the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer  
but he's afflicted with loser-itis  
dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him  
truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun  
this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him  
we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor  
however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs  
as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed  
he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah  
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation  
with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him  
however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges  
goats beware ! 
he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies  
what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich  
equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black  
 "" it's reverse racism , "" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything  
this element doesn't work the first time it's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence  
you don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that "" the animal "" is tame  
if there's any reason to see this film , it's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut  
remember her ? 
she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , "" survivor  "" 
here , she plays marvin's sunny love interest  
while her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog    yuck ! )  
with her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making "
-1," "" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us  "" 
starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung 
taiwan , 24/12/99  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap  
this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that  
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background  
instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's  
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room  
this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways  
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole  
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication  
and they say romance is dead  
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are  
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people  
they are ciphers  
instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles  
 ( this is as fascinating as it sounds  ) 
offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china )  
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights  
sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail "

-1,"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico  
the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out  
while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence  
that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line  
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene  
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that  
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  
and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it  
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires  
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans  
this has not always been carpenter's style  
his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question  
jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows  
in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is  
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin )  
to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust  
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico  
if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is  
the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin  
but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them  
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown  
fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? 
the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog  
now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona  
woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well  
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing  
while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target  
woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero  
that is not his style and it just does not work very well "

at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies "

showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence  
some people , however , keep their clothes on  
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them  
that's why this review will be short  
it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores  
there is no story , script , point or acting  
only naked bodies , which is exactly the point  
here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile  
no one is twisting nomi's arm  
no one is holding her grandmother hostage  
she wants to do this  
and that is what she is doing till the end credits  
so what's the problem then ? 
what's the point ? 
what's the film about ? 
is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? 
this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck  
believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody  
elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script  
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better  
her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public  
 "" i am not a whore ! 
i am a dancer "" , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing  
in fact the acting in "" showgirls "" brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level  
not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning  
it is a total waste of time and money  
there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence  
the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another  
its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe  
 "" in my films , "" writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , "" i hold the mirror up to life  "" 
well , excuse me ? 
his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it "" show the naked truth "" , is simplified and unreal  
occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : "" hey , i see you  
i see that you're hiding "" - "" from what ? "" 
- "" from you ""  
yes , and even the only decent line in this film : "" nomi is what las vegas is all about "" can't save 'showgirls' from going under  
it's a strange phenomena "
-1,"one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film  
after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave  
he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing  
however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year  
the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation  
these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly  
it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it's only when things are over that they make sense  "" 
whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided  
the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone  
instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last  
only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it  
but don't fret , it will surface again  
you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile  
but you hold hope for some time  
the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations  
it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope  
and with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? 
to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene  
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful  
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him  
and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities  
the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them  
unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene  
sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words  
the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image  
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners  
the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies  
steven spielberg is picked on in particular  
while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood  
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller  
the days of breathless are no more "

i * did * go into this one with high expectations  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks  
when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard  
the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in  
they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house  
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  
she starts having some wild hallucinations  
later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand )  
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ  
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  
it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again  
so , she helps him kill three businessmen  
scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  
problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin  
he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother  
guess they couldn't get the original actor back  
who knows  
scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two  "" 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun  
this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 
 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear  
for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby  
anyway "

that's what we do ! "" 
--- dr  alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats  
alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  
oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time  
sound familiar ? 
such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  
dina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  
with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! )  
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
in this respect , the film never disappointed me  
this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane  
the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think )  
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face  
thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  
dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers    
the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception  
while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either  
she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half  
lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  
although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  
the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's  
he is relegated to the "" i'm not sticking around here ! "" 
character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  
anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it  
even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever "
-1,"plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music  
one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g  i  , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig )  
once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce  
at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star  
that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants  
this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers  
critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through  
in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet  
i guess that i was expecting the former going in  
the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant  
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience  
chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen )  
well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole "" show "" atmosphere of this movie either  
i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the "" so the butterfly represents his freedom ? "" 
side of things  
all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled  
what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? 
what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? 
 ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) 
what ever happened to the lawsuit ? 
and more    
all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat  
if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well  
i didn't get it  
the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either  
then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen  
some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added "" atmosphere "" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience  
but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied  
i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers  
i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene  
note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single "" mainstream "" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself "
-1,"please don't mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam    i 
just want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda  
it's not even worth a 99-cent video rental  
don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) 
btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper )  
now i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing  
here goes : 
movie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night  
even then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) 
why do i hate anaconda ? 
let me count the ways    
first of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong  
as an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises  
whew  
i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it  
unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel  
my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end  
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually  
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep  
he was the most likable character in the movie  
who wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? 
anaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy , for instance  
however , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock  
the writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines  
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny  
did she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? 
of course not ! 
 "" i'm trying to work ! "" 
gee , that's even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with  
she could have told him to go find a knothole or something    
 ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks )  
as for the plot , i'm still trying to find one "
-1,"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard  
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun  
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters  
and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review  
thrillers are all variations on a theme  
you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet  
you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process  
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner  
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror     
is anyone else getting depressed here ? 
point is , it's not enough to follow the formula  
you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version  
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails  
that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f  
bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire  
richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal  
the jackal is trying to kill someone  
gere is trying to stop him  
will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? 
 ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count  ) 
there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , "" i wonder what happens next ? "" 
the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines  
it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium  
throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them  
no surprise  
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy  
instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script )  
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight "

-1,"you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year  
they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season )  
combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film  
howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground )  
in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire  
william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak  
he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby  
his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him  
soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters  
why canadian ? 
who knows , eh ? 
along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage  
enter howie long  
he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help  
when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage  
long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much  
although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better  
the script doesn't help him out any , however  
all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny  
the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable  
long's co-stars are a mixed bag  
at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles  
forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here )  
suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do  
some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland  
you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals  
that's not the case  
there's a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences    we've 
seen this stuff before  
it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) "
-1,"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident  
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail  
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of  
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know  
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
film is a different medium  
it is a visual medium  
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize  
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space  
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner  
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film  
it really verges on being tedious at least at times  
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects  
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it  
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco  
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking  
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs  
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? 
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider  
this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well  
and in the end , he failed  
to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short  
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist  
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand  
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer )  
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it  
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world  
terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power  
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home  
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly "

the good news is that sandler doesn't actually appear in "" deuce "" and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler  
schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted deuce believable

there's the expected amount of toilet humor in "" deuce  "" 
 ( for one thing , deuce's dad is a men's room attendant )  
does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ? 
for most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is  
i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed  
bottom line : "" deuce "" doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently funny "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes "

-1,"everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals  ' 
in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience  
the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches  
dr  susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches  
the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone  
'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill  
the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case     it's 
humans  
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs  
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace  
perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become  
if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest  
the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie  
there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking  
if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense  
in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better  sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them  
there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch  
the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them  
the peformances are o  k , if slightly below average  
sorvino is o  k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really  
the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever  
their reasonable good fun , however  
mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good "
-1,"woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker  
in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy  
from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles  
some of these work better than others  
zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist  
deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back  
harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives  
he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing  
the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments  
perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out  
as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises  
the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life  
these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters  
it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person  
if that sounds complicated , it is  
then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image  
harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time  
as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order  
if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable  
but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand  
deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement  
harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him  
just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear  
harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal )  
block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father  
another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems  
harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman )  
it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film  
while the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny  
the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry "
-1,"with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well  
with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining  
however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere  
this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment  
considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing  
the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors  
however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft  
along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber  ) 
they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens  
unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere  
the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier  
the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on  
the actors and directing don't help , either  
hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie  
stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman  
the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere  
but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone  
the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through  
the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action  
the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) 
the writing doesn't help much , either  
although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud  
the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent  
practically every line is just stating the obvious  
none of it is smart  
also , where the hell did the budget go ? 
the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess  
there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget  
i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would  
but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid  
finally , the film has no idea what genre to be  
levison can't handle his own plot "

the stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's "" outer space "" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home  
yes , in terms of acting , the star power is  
  
  
well , more like a falling star  
kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead  
lost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name  
it's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population  
john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet  
earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years  
john's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham )  
despite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space  
unknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission  
dr  smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr  smith has re-programmed a talking robot to "" destroy robinson family "" ! 
when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete  
as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground  
it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? 
chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium  
if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! 
that's just her normal voice ! 
in yet another example of a "" friend "" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod  
graham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film  
hurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left  
if hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill  
johnson isn't dull , he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time  
want an example of how cool this kid can be ? 
how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? 
hey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr  rogers-would-be-proud sentiment  
but alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known )  
why hire an actress ? 
they could've had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it  
now that would've had some pizzazz ! 
lost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have  
the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse "

a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one  
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience  
in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film  
welcome to my review of the general's daughter  
plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder  
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder  
critique : by the numbers ( see above )  
this film is just there  
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again  
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away  
it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree  
it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament  
get the picture ? 
i sure did    it's 
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed  
easy as pie  
it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted  ) 
woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems )  
and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen  
it's like riding a bike  
other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually "" breaking down "" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the "" best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott "" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director

keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot  
how could this not be a blockbuster ? 
all die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on  
ol "" much ado about nothing "" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago  
to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university  
by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics  
this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in  
a potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost  
surely nobody could have any problems with that ? 
morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor  
he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public  
he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly  
so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location  
unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script  
this movie is just dying for a comparison with "" the fugitive ""  
both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere  
the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward  
credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters  
where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop  
it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while  
harrison ford was "" the man against the world  "" 
he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well  
in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone  
now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion  
we don't get this  
we get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie  
the producers here probably thought , "" hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ? 
let's rope in that morgan to help us out  "" 
well , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either  
the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder  
it's not really his fault  
once again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters  
someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken "

 "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us  
at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season  
at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score  
then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what's going on , you'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? 
the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture  
it feels like an eternity  
most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks  
the film is based on alberto caesella's play "" death takes a holiday ""  
the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes ""  
soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death ""  
it is bill's time  
but death has other plans  
it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive

bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone's attention  
bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side , lives in his house and resides at his office  
that is not all , however  
bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her  
this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences  
it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill's family for dinner  
when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different  
it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure  
it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth   "" 
to create a motion picture out of this is another  
four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic  
it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film  
on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" )  
hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it  
his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment "

patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman 
mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff  "" 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ? 
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality  
the film industry is like any other  
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used  
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary  
for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit  
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones

checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around  
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems  
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia  
as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton )  
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students  
he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness  "" 
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing  
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies  
then it struck me  
it must be based on a true story

taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling  
jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age  
at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc  --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate  
it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't  
the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy  
for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins  
the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan  
seen now , it does not seem provocative  
indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull  
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined  
nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material  
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief "
-1,"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony  
naturally , this got me worried  
would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? 
if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in  
if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel  
unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm  
carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman  
as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else  
the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler  ) 
hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead  
plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose  
although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film  
carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped  
it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script  
the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story  
also , major events , such as mr  cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened  
the story is a bit of a mess , frankly  
the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest  
her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on  
she looks nice , though  
more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well  
ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character  
i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived  
although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets  
but production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess  
jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place  
the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty  
plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment  
although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel  
there's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers "

-1,"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask  
i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series  
however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs  data  
somewhere along the line , the "" star trek "" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction  
its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters  
generations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t  kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name  
no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy  
among those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr  soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world  
seventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart )  
soran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains  
i don't think it is an insult to fans of "" star trek "" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a "" trek "" film  
it's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy  
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen  
data ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing  
in the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year  
what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? 
he doesn't get a joke  
once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know  
if the rest of the "" next generation "" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing  
but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew  
it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen  
the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away  
perhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast  
stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players  
by contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film  
these characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy  
only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have  
it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again "
-1,"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything  
a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l  jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with  
it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why  
right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible  
a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead  
after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial  
mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics  
the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have  
sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box  
the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part  
i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact  
there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this  
because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting  
one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic  
i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter  
the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes  
first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma  
he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade  
the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story  
it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics  
another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character  
i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible  
 ( see the virgin spring for more on that note  ) 
is jackson's character then simply insane ? 
that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either  
one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information  
mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense  
how did the prosecution get this information ? 
how come he didn't get it ? 
the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion  
this is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters  
it's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending "

the drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action  
back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see "" the philadelphia story "" for a great farce  
 "" town & country "" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels  
but , there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is "" t&c's "" downfall  
there is , obviously , a great deal of hollywood talent , in front of and behind the camera , involved in "" town & country , "" but , without a likable or , at least , interesting story to carry through their efforts , it is all for naught  
and , that's what we get here - naught  
porter stoddard ( beatty ) is a high-powered new york architect with a very good life indeed  
his 25-year marriage to ellie ( diane keaton ) appears , on the surface , to be perfect  
but , there are cracks just below this pristine surface  
his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts , his kids don't need him and his best friends , griffin ( garry shandling ) and mona ( goldie hawn ) , are in the midst of a divorce  
porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper  
at the 90-minute mark of "" town & country "" i asked myself , "" what's the point ? "" 
i wasn't entertained , i laughed three times - over silly little pratfalls - and spent most of the film marking time 'til the end  
warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog , making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head  
keaton's ellie is an empty headed flake who can't see the obvious as porter screws around on her  
and , as you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ? 
the supporting cast is given nothing to do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use  
nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling  
the actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air-headed musician and the character doesn't belong , anyway  
jenna elfman is a sweet , but smart , ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures  
andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress ( is there any other kind in this movie ? ) 
who comes on to porter  
the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf's by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell's very strange parents  
glib rationalization of infidelity , like , "" if he doesn't speak english , it doesn't count , "" are a staple for the screenplay  
the morality of the film seems to be , if you can get away with it , go for it  
the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn't want to know , never mind befriend  
the actors do their best , but are hamstrung by the weak material  
helmer chelsom , who made the outstanding , offbeat comedy "" funny bones , "" is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on "" town & country  "" 
the production values are high , as one expects from a big budget hollywood film  
but , the opulent sets by caroline hanania , lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top-notch photography by william fraker cannot save "" town & country  ""

-1,"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr  )  
the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy  
the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial  
filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster  
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed  
at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be  
the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love  
then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart  
why ? 
well , because they have to  
otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after  
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic  
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead  
a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat  
the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well  
stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair )  
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film  
you know , the average porn star  
the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes  
she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted  
attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up  
these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes  
what happened here ? 
the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places )  
writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off  
in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences  
the direction is film-school-grad obvious  
it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of "" cops , "" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion  
plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera  
this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr  which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that "
-1,"as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times  
but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber  
it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything  
the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful  
this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor  
well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded  
along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber  
thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience  
the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own  
this is there strictly for the kids  
the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs  
although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone  
the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible  
admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor )  
the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable  
the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? 
this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance  
as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie  
giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof  brainard's flying robot weebo  
giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie  
the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good  
now , weebo is a totally different story  
it's a robot that prof  brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too  
this is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie  
yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters  
the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all  
the acting by robin williams ( prof  
brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced  
most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 "

making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape  
sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention  
comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn  
mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened ? 
why is spawn so bad ? 
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film  
i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc  spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath )  
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero  
a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda  
having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda  
simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married  
despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld  
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so  
when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters  
spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman )  
john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second  
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator "

-1,"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates  
frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement  
unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller  
almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities  
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled  
unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening  
this is a very bad sign  
not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder  
of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters  
a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling )  
emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas )  
their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen )  
when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband  
instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily  
 ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest  ) 
ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair  
not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting  
 ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't  ) 
steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes  
the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks  
michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he's gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife  
gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here  
she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers ( the other being hush )  
at least viggo mortensen ( g  i  
jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies  
the thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily's best friend  
a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end  
there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start  
it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living "

-1,"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us  
if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie  
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film  
but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film  
for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers  
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well  
unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers  
that title would be the confusing  
ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly  
it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb  
liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth  
the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money  
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film  
first , the house is great- looking  
it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot  
it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it  
this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film  
things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight  
haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie  
the hill house is not eerie  
it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening  
ever heard of lili taylor ? 
before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now  
she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film  
despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind  
owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor  
he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas  
all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped  
wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs  
liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film  
their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot "
-1,"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival  
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival  
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time  
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart  
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it  
something else is what he did  
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life  
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep  
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada  
she wants to build a career as an actress  
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow  
she does not know who the woman is  
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is  
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not  
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own  
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george )  
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong  
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion  
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits  
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun  
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film  
he just chooses not to  
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason  
there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches  
the film is a little long for the subject matter  
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot  
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers  
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale

and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole  
naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon    
the movie  
when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the "" lewis and clark "" has to go to investigate , and dr  william weir , the creator of the "" event horizon , "" gets to come along for the ride  
if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is "" infinite terror  "" 
well , i don't know about the "" terror "" part , but "" infinite "" certainly seems to qualify    
event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film  
it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes  
at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien  
that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever  
it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller  
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore  
you've seen this kind of movie before  
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility  
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago  
it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price  
there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably  
paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat  
there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity  
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon  
and richard t  jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has "
-1,"i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film  
for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored  
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl  
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries  
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways  
it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing  
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy  
the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place  
but it sure is a fascinating failure  
marky  
  
  
er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman  
he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything )  
he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr  )  
they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex  
they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen  
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in  
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father  
when they do this , it turns out she is paris'  
  
  
goddaughter ! 
it's very bad to have paris against you  
the story is standard action film stuff  
it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling )  
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy  
it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior )  
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story  
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns "

-1,"there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact  
i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release  
the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes  
deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking  
the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense  
the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem  
it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail  
how do we know this ? 
because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading  
ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie  
successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots  
television is what's wrong with deep impact  
the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy  
she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area  
when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps  
 "" i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being  "" 
she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet  
upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question  
and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star  
leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth  
and i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality  
so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up  
such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process  
but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail  
they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth  
yeah , thanks , nasa  
that's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years  
they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave  
if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie  
instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town "
-1,"if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! 
indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them  
it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film  
but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show  
what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? 
first , the movie gives us an introductory premise  
huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared  
oooh    scary ! 
secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score  
third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams )  
he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy  
finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him  
they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are  
during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs  
spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way  
little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster  
yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds  
this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film  
their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat  
those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed  
the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have  
yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary "" boo "" moments  
but most of it is just outright silly  
and this film is unusually gory too  
monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains  
there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive  
he screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away  
additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films  
the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock  
to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was "

-1,"the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story  
the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  
however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device  
those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed  
mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism  
the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow  
i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible  
once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect  
while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense  
the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure  
unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death  
the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player  
soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them  
along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens )  
why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? 
apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called "" mercury  "" 
to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds' puzzle magazine  "" 
of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is  
when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa  
as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course  
but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has  
it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly  
for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding  
the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness  
overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory  
bruce willis' star seems to be fading  
this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal  
willis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does  
alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace  
the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger  
mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u "

critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending  
it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us  
it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark "" junkyard "" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever    ) , and all the sets look like     well ,

the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point  
i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was  
some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at  
thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7  5/10 )  
it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent

-1,"shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen  
it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies  
that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort  
shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work  
the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books  
philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london  
it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan  
however , to directly quote the film , he has "" cash flow problems  "" 
through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts  
so , mr  henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production  
however , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well  
he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper  
then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block  
there are many other little issues that mr  henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing  
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author  
ironically , that couldn't be truer here  
the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors  
one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love  
so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits  
the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres  
joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though  
he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad  
gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well  
however , the supporting cast does almost save the day  
geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking  
they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links  
you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting  ) "

-1," "" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney  
it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless  
what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film  
hypothetically , i mean  
 "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ? 
the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show-stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse  
the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded  
in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning  
doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? 
anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss  "" 
philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j  barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to  
through a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough  
a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again )  
and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him  
yuckity-yuck  
what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is  
you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up  
earlier in '97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much  
disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively  
in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic  "" 
such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh  
i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes  
who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? 
didn't think so  
it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable  
philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams  
williams is a brilliant comic actor    okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad  
those times , he's not bad  
but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? 
maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s "
-1,"recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep  
he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour  
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food  
then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot  
and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the "" on "" button  
the result ? 
william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure  
though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure  
the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds  
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on  
and filming the dialogue in voice over  
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model  
and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom  
and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion  
i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude  
however i've seen terrible films that are fun to watch  
 ( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau  
 ) that rule doesn't apply here  
this is a film that takes itself seriously  
that is it's major fault  
another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout  
 ) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn't take sides  
here it's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo  
 ( just look at the way they film him  
 ) from the begining he's our hero and this doesn't work  
and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help  
luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us  
the result is a mess  
you can feel him striving to be something he isn't  
he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles  
he tries very hard "

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent  
it would be derisive  
it would be glib  
it would be dismissive  
it would be entirely accurate  
rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging  
the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous  
the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables  
despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities  
consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent  
louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene  
 ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand  ) 
meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice  
serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky  
it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest  
it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr  d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr  lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr  madsen , ms  demornay , and mr  whaley have all done good work in the past  
none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes  
director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one  
while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr  cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization  
to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies  
i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened  
to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question "
-1,"kids today , they don't just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr  loving on the ladies  
no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball  
through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there's no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention  
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a's , where he is hoping for his big break  
it's only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman's thong ( don't ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! 
 ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn't even bother    
but of course he makes a play for her  
summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan's non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas )  
worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that '70s show's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs  robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham  
in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it's been done better somewhere else  
for starters , the film has a major question of identity  
it's definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance  
the worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion  
by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart  
dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice  
coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint  
ryan's catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to "" play catch "" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy  
ryan's stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-'em-tiger-we're-behind-you talk  
and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel  
before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr  is capable of having a thought of his own ? 
don't answer that  
the only real joy in the film is found in biel's character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet  
she's the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade  
when she's on screen , the time flies by  
when she's not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long  
for a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? 
for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards  
hollywood is either about to eat her alive "
-1,"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller  
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  
writer steven e  desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little  
van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u  s  --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans  
it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter    
    which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_  
while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ )  
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" 
and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "" 
standing out among my favorites  
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs  
van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual  
early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way  
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug  
paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode  
in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage  
tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work  
here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise  
for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous  
this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context  
for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box  
as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen  
it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something  
the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired "
-1,"five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake  
the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! )  
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r  a  m  r  # 
1521 )  
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here  
orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two )  
yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too  
i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability  
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film  
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks  
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line  
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens  
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot  
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress  
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office  
i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible )  
the script for this film is completely pathetic  
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible  
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along  
here is an example of the wonderful dialog  
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun  
the line is "" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it  "" 
this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy  
now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented  
one comment from an actress is "" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it  "" 
i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get  
now lets talk about the great special effects for this film "
